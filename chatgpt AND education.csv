Overview: ChatGPT, a LLM trained on massive amounts of textual data, is adept at fulfilling various language-related tasks. Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT has serious limitations, such as occasionally giving incorrect answers, producing nonsensical content, and presenting misinformation as fact. Dental practitioners, assistants, and hygienists are not likely to be significantly impacted by LLMs. However, LLMs could affect the work of administrative personnel and the provision of dental telemedicine. LLMs offer potential for clinical decision support, text summarization, efficient writing, and multilingual communication. As more people seek health information from LLMs, it is crucial to safeguard against inaccurate, outdated, and biased responses to health-related queries. LLMs pose challenges for patient data confidentiality and cybersecurity that must be tackled. In dental education, LLMs present fewer challenges than in other academic fields. LLMs can enhance academic writing fluency, but acceptable usage boundaries in science need to be established. Conclusions: While LLMs such as ChatGPT may have various useful applications in dental medicine, they come with risks of malicious use and serious limitations, including the potential for misinformation. Clinical Significance: Along with the potential benefits of using LLMs as an additional tool in dental medicine, it is crucial to carefully consider the limitations and potential risks inherent in such artificial intelligence technologies. © 2023 The Authors.

We examine the evolution of these tools, and highlight the potential ways that LLMs can support in the education of students in digital writing and beyond, including the teaching of writing and composition, the possibilities of co-creation between humans and AI, supporting EFL learners, and improving Automated Writing Evaluations (AWE). We describe and demonstrate the potential that these tools have in creating original, coherent text that can avoid detection by existing technological methods of detection and trained academic staff alike, demonstrating a major academic integrity concern related to the use of these tools by students. Analysing the various issues related to academic integrity that LLMs raise for both Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and students, we conclude that it is not the student use of any AI tools that defines whether plagiarism or a breach of academic integrity has occurred, but whether any use is made clear by the student. Deciding whether any particular use of LLMs by students can be defined as academic misconduct is determined by the academic integrity policies of any given HEI, which must be updated to consider how these tools will be used in future educational environments. Practitioner Notes 1. Students now have easy access to advanced Artificial Intelligence based tools such as ChatGPT. These tools use Large Language Models (LLMs) and can be used to create original written content that students may use in their assessments. 2. These tools can be accessed using commercial services built on this software, often targeted to students as a means of ‘assisting’ students with assessments. 3. The output created by these LLMs is coherent enough for it not to be detected by academic staff members, or traditional text-matching software used to detect plagiarism, but falsified references may hint at their use if unchanged by students. 4. The use of these tools may not necessarily be considered as plagiarism if students are transparent in how they have been used in any submission, however it may be a breach of academic integrity policies of any given Higher Education Institution (HEI). 5. There are legitimate uses of these tools in supporting the education of students, meaning HEIs must carefully consider how policies dealing with student use of this software are created. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

The current systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders in health care education, research, and practice is urgently needed. This will help to set a code of ethics to guide the responsible use of ChatGPT among other LLMs in health care and academia. © 2023 by the author.","","artificial intelligence; digital health; ethics; healthcare; machine learning","","","","","Sarker I.H., AI-Based Modeling: Techniques, Applications and Research Issues Towards Automation, Intelligent and Smart Systems, SN Comput.

We used the SWOT analysis framework to outline ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses and to discuss its opportunities for and threats to education. The strengths include using a sophisticated natural language model to generate plausible answers, self-improving capability, and providing personalised and real-time responses. As such, ChatGPT can increase access to information, facilitate personalised and complex learning, and decrease teaching workload, thereby making key processes and tasks more efficient. The weaknesses are a lack of deep understanding, difficulty in evaluating the quality of responses, a risk of bias and discrimination, and a lack of higher-order thinking skills. Threats to education include a lack of understanding of the context, threatening academic integrity, perpetuating discrimination in education, democratising plagiarism, and declining high-order cognitive skills.

As of now, ChatGPT can write pretty convincing student-level prose, but it is still not very good at answering quantitatively rich questions. Therefore, for the time being, the preceding concerns may not be shared by a large portion of the numeracy education community. However, as Google and WolframAlpha are definitely capable of answering standard and some non-standard quantitative queries, a future generation of artificial intelligence including both types of capabilities is not out of the question. So, the issue is still relevant to the readers of this journal. As we continue to focus on the higher-level skills and habits of mind that make up quantitative literacy (QL) and quantitative reasoning (QR), we should not forget that basic literacy and numeracy are still foundational building blocks. While AI is making advances in these basic realms, our human students seem to be losing ground, as implied by the most recent NAEP scores. Here we encourage our readership to focus on what makes QL/QR so challenging to teach, to human as well as artificial intelligences. © 2023, National Numeracy Network.

ChatGPT is an AI tool that offers a range of benefits, including increased student engagement, collaboration, and accessibility. However, is also raises concerns regarding academic honesty and plagiarism. This paper examines the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in higher education, and discusses the potential risks and rewards of these tools. The paper also considers the difficulties of detecting and preventing academic dishonesty, and suggests strategies that universities can adopt to ensure ethical and responsible use of these tools. These strategies include developing policies and procedures, providing training and support, and using various methods to detect and prevent cheating. The paper concludes that while the use of AI in higher education presents both opportunities and challenges, universities can effectively address these concerns by taking a proactive and ethical approach to the use of these tools. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","detection and prevention; higher education; Machine-generated writing; plagiarism","","","","","Ahsan K., Akbar S., Kam B., Contract cheating in higher education: A systematic literature review and future research agenda, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 47, 4, pp. 523-539, (2022); Barber M., Bird L., Fleming J., Titterington-Giles E., Edwards E., Leyland C., Gravity assist: Propelling higher education towards a brighter future, (2021); Bommasani R., Hudson D.A., Adeli E., Altman R., Arora S., von Arx S., Bernstein M.S., Bohg J., Bosselut A., Brunskill E., Brynjolfsson E., Buch S., Card D., Castellon R., Chatterji N., Chen A., Creel K., Davis J.Q., Demszky D., Liang P., On the opportunities and risks of foundation models, (2021); Brown T.B., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Askell A., Agarwal S., Herbert-Voss A., Krueger G., Henighan T., Child R., Ramesh A., Ziegler D.M., Wu J., Winter C., Amodei D., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Dawson P., Sutherland-Smith W., Can markers detect contract cheating?

Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is an artificial intelligence technology that generates conversational interactions to user prompts. The trained model can answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests. The functionality of ChatGPT in answering chemistry assessment questions requires investigation to ascertain its potential impact on learning and assessment. Two chemistry-focused modules in year 1 and year 2 of a pharmaceutical science program are used to study and evaluate ChatGPT-generated responses in relation to the end-of-year exam assessments. For questions that focused on knowledge and understanding with “describe” and “discuss” verbs, the ChatGPT generated responses. For questions that focused on application of knowledge and interpretation with nontext information, the ChatGPT technology reached a limitation. A further analysis of the quality of responses is reported in this study. ChatGPT is not considered a high-risk technology tool in relation to cheating. Similar to the COVID-19 disruption, ChatGPT is expected to provide a catalyst for educational discussions on academic integrity and assessment design. © 2023 The Authors.

Just as any technological advance opens discussions about ethics, so the implications of AI for HPE ethics need to be identified, anticipated, and accommodated so that HPE can utilise AI without compromising crucial ethical principles. Rather than focussing on AI technology, this Guide focuses on the ethical issues likely to face HPE teachers and administrators as they encounter and use AI systems in their teaching environment. While many of the ethical principles may be familiar to readers in other contexts, they will be viewed in light of AI, and some unfamiliar issues will be introduced. They include data gathering, anonymity, privacy, consent, data ownership, security, bias, transparency, responsibility, autonomy, and beneficence. In the Guide, each topic explains the concept and its importance and gives some indication of how to cope with its complexities. Ideas are drawn from personal experience and the relevant literature. In most topics, further reading is suggested so that readers may further explore the concepts at their leisure. The aim is for HPE teachers and decision-makers at all levels to be alert to these issues and to take proactive action to be prepared to deal with the ethical problems and opportunities that AI usage presents to HPE. © 2023 The Author(s).

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability. Methods: We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT’s performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question. Results: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT’s answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively. Conclusions: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT’s capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning. ©Aidan Gilson, Conrad W Safranek, Thomas Huang, Vimig Socrates, Ling Chi, Richard Andrew Taylor, David Chartash.","","artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; conversational agent; education technology; generative pre-trained transformer; GPT; machine learning; medical education; MedQA; natural language processing; NLP","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (T35DK104689); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; Yale School of Medicine, YSM","This publication was made possible by the Yale School of Medicine Fellowship for Medical Student Research.

Design/methodology/approach: This is a conceptual paper. Findings: ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize tourism education and research because it can do what students and researchers should do, namely, generate text (assignments and research papers). Universities will need to reevaluate their teaching and assessment strategies and incorporate generative language models in teaching. Publishers will need to be more receptive toward manuscripts that are partially generated by artificial intelligence. In the future, digital teachers and research assistants will take over many of the cognitive tasks of tourism educators and researchers.

Here, we appraise the roles of theory-based approaches focusing on the experiment-dominated wet-biology research areas of microbial growth and survival, cell physiology, host–pathogen interactions, and competitive or symbiotic interactions. Additional examples relate to analyses of genome-sequence data, climate change and planetary health, habitability, and astrobiology. We assess the importance of thought at each step of the research process; the roles of natural philosophy, and inconsistencies in logic and language, as drivers of scientific progress; the value of thought experiments; the use and limitations of artificial intelligence technologies, including their potential for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research; and other instances when theory is the most-direct and most-scientifically robust route to scientific novelty including the development of techniques for practical experimentation or fieldwork. We highlight the intrinsic need for human engagement in scientific innovation, an issue pertinent to the ongoing controversy over papers authored using/authored by artificial intelligence (such as the large language model/chatbot ChatGPT). Other issues discussed are the way in which aspects of language can bias thinking towards the spatial rather than the temporal (and how this biased thinking can lead to skewed scientific terminology); receptivity to research that is non-mainstream; and the importance of theory-based science in education and epistemology. Whereas we briefly highlight classic works (those by Oakes Ames, Francis H.C. Crick and James D. Watson, Charles R. Darwin, Albert Einstein, James E. Lovelock, Lynn Margulis, Gilbert Ryle, Erwin R.J.A. Schrödinger, Alan M. Turing, and others), the focus is on microbiology studies that are more-recent, discussing these in the context of the scientific process and the types of scientific novelty that they represent. These include several studies carried out during the 2020 to 2022 lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic when access to research laboratories was disallowed (or limited). We interviewed the authors of some of the featured microbiology-related papers and—although we ourselves are involved in laboratory experiments and practical fieldwork—also drew from our own research experiences showing that such studies can not only produce new scientific findings but can also transcend barriers between disciplines, act counter to scientific reductionism, integrate biological data across different timescales and levels of complexity, and circumvent constraints imposed by practical techniques. In relation to urgent research needs, we believe that climate change and other global challenges may require approaches beyond the experiment. © 2023 The Authors.

The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","","Artificial intelligence; Education; Educational technologies; Large language models","","","","","Abdelghani R., Wang Y.-H., Yuan X., Wang T., Sauzeon H., Oudeyer P.-Y., GPT-3-driven pedagogical agents for training children's curious question-asking skills, (2022); Ahuja A.S., Polascik B.W., Doddapaneni D., Byrnes E.S., Sridhar J., The digital metaverse: Applications in artificial intelligence, medical education, and integrative health, Integrative Medicine Research, 12, 1, (2023); Ayanwale M.A., Sanusi I.T., Adelana O.P., Aruleba K.D., Oyelere S.S., Teachers’ readiness and intention to teach artificial intelligence in schools, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, (2022); Bao M., Can home use of speech-enabled artificial intelligence mitigate foreign language anxiety–investigation of a concept, Arab World English Journal (AWEJ), Special Issue on CALL, (2019); Becker B.A., Denny P., Finnie-Ansley J., Luxton-Reilly A., Prather J., Santos E.A., Programming is hard–or at least it used to be: Educational opportunities and challenges of ai code generation, (2022); Bernius J.P., Krusche S., Bruegge B., Machine learning based feedback on textual student answers in large courses.

In this commentary, we discuss the potential impacts of GAI text-based systems for the chemistry community. The recent launch of ChatGPT, a free GAI text-based system by OpenAI, has sparked concerns regarding academic integrity and student assessment across all educational levels. However, the capabilities of these systems will impact more than the teaching and learning of chemistry; GAI systems can serve students, faculty, and administrators for teaching and learning, research, and professional activities. Herein we explore various ways students and faculty might use GAI systems, identify potential benefits and risks, and consider equity and accessibility issues. We hope to inspire productive discussions on leveraging GAI technology’s capabilities while recognizing its limitations. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","","Communication/Writing; Curriculum; First-Year Undergraduate/General; General Public; Graduate Education/Research; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Professional Development; Second-Year Undergraduate; Upper-Division Undergraduate","","","","","EDITORIAL: OpenAI’s ChatGPT raises concerns over academic integrity, authenticity, The Daily Targum, (2022); Bowman E., A new AI chatbot might do your homework for you.

Existing literature offers a wealth of research on design, deploying and evaluating AI-driven systems in education. However, the challenges related to the growing influence of AI in the society, calls for revisiting research foundations of AI in education in order to inform decision-making in policy and guide future research. This special issue of Computers & Education: Artificial Intelligence brings 11 papers that explore the theme of empowering learners for the age of AI. The contributions of these papers can be broadly grouped into seven main themes: intersection between AI and humans that looks at the space of coordination; assessment that explores challenges and opportunities afforded by the use of AI in educational assessment; explainability in AI as a critical need for humans in education to understand and trust AI; design for learning that offers principles for designing AI-driven systems and educational opportunities; conceptual AI and learning exploring the need for the development of new theories of learning and their connections with existing theoretical foundations in education; accurate predictions and their role in future education; and applications of AI in classrooms and educational systems. The findings of these studies highlight pressing research and policies challenges and opportunities that arise with the broad penetration of AI in education. They also emphasize the need for future research that addresses issues of ethics, bias and farness in the use of AI in education; challenges associated with data sources and ownership as the key fuel and enabler of present-day AI generation; AI literacies and competencies of stakeholders who use and are impacted by AI in education; identification of effective learning and teaching practices with the use of AI; and policy development to increase responsiveness of education systems to rapid changes driven by AI. © 2023","","","","","CELLA; Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom, (ES/S015701/1); XAI-ED; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP210100060, DP220101209); Jacobs Foundation","Funding text 1: This special issue was in part supported by funding from Australian Research Council ( DP210100060 , DP220101209 ), Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom ( ES/S015701/1 ), and Jacobs Foundation (CELLA 2 CERES) awarded to the first author.

What is being coordinated in this space? Currently, almost everything related to learning is under examination. Molenar (2022) focuses on tasks that can be “offloaded from humans to AI” (p. 1) and then “onloaded from AI to humans” (p.1), focusing specifically on a hybrid systems to help develop self regulated learning skills in young learners. She offers a hybrid model of regulation, emphasizing four regulation degrees: AI, co-regulation, shared-regulation, and self-regulation with an intent to support SRL developing through interaction with AI. Markauskaite et al. (2022) explore this middle space by engaging a number of experts in the learning analytics and AI fields to articulate some direction of an “interconnected, fast changing world” where “agentic machines” (p. 1) are the norm. Their Table 1 captures the range of perspectives regarding what capabilities are needed, how we develop those capabilities in humans, and how we study the development of those capabilities. Siemens et al. (2022) suggest that intelligence is too broad a term to provide utility when assessing which specific tasks or activities should be conducted by human or machine. Instead, they argue that cognition and discrete cognitive activities should be the foundation for evaluating and assessing how people learn, sensemake, and make decisions when agents with cognitive capacity are present.The third major theme of this issue relates to explainability of AI. Explainability refers to the ability of humans to understand and trust AI. This need will increase in importance, especially as the intersections between human and AI require greater collaboration and coordination (see Carvalho et al., 2022; Markauskaite et al., 2022; Molenar, 2022; Siemens et al., 2022). Khosravi et al. (2022) introduce the XAI-ED, detailing how existing explainable AI approaches can be applied to the education sector. XAI-ED incorporates insight from numerous fields, including cognitive and learning sciences, AI, human computer interaction, and learning analytics in order to present a “means for educational tool developers and researchers” (p. 4) with the means to support the “creation of trustworthy, AI-augmented, sociotechnical systems” (p. 18). They then present four case studies that detail how XAI-ED is reflected in different AIED systems: learner sourced, open-ended learning environments, writing analytics, and team-based learning. They conclude by advocating for broader discussion around explainable AI in education, increased research and adoption of these models, and involvement of multiple stakeholders in developing tools and systems.This special issue was in part supported by funding from Australian Research Council (DP210100060, DP220101209), Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom (ES/S015701/1), and Jacobs Foundation (CELLA 2 CERES) awarded to the first author.

The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer.

Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”). © 2023 The Authors","","Academic integrity; Bard; ChatGPT; Critical analysis; DALL-E; Education; Educator; Ethics; Future of education; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Google; Management education; Management educator; OpenAI; Paradox; Paradox theory; Ragnarök; Reformation; Transformation; Transformative education","","","","","Queensland to join NSW in banning access to ChatGPT in state schools, ABC News, (2023); Ali F., Let the devil speak for itself: Should ChatGPT be allowed or banned in hospitality and tourism schools?, Journal of Global Hospitality and Tourism, 2, 1, pp. 1-6, (2023); Alt D., Students' social media engagement and fear of missing out (FoMO) in a diverse classroom, Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 29, 2, pp. 388-410, (2017); Principles for ethical use of personalized student data, (2020); Brehm J.W., Psychological reactance: Theory and applications, Advances in Consumer Research, 16, pp. 72-75, (1989); Why we fall for fake news, (2023); Chatterjee J., Dethlefs N., This new conversational AI model can be your friend, philosopher, and guide … and even your worst enemy, Pattern, 4, 1, (2023); Cheddadi S., Bouache M., Improving equity and access to higher education using artificial intelligence, The 16th international Conference on computer science & education (ICCSE 2021), pp. 18-20, (2021); Dencik L., Sanchez-Monedero J., Data justice, Internet Policy Review, 11, 1, pp. 1-16, (2022); Dibble M., Schools ban ChatGPT amid fears of artificial intelligence-assisted cheating, (2023); Dowling M., Lucey B., ChatGPT for (finance) research: The Bananarama conjecture, Finance Research Letters, (2023); Fatemi G., Saito E., Unintentional plagiarism and academic integrity: The challenges and needs of postgraduate international students in Australia, Journal of Further and Higher Education, 44, 10, pp. 1305-1319, (2020); Ferraro C., Wheeler M.A., Pallant J.I., Wilson S.G., Oldmeadow J., Not so ‘trustless’ after all: Trust in Web3 technology and opportunities for brands, Business Horizons, (2023); Hair J.F., Hult G.T.M., Ringle C.M., Sarstedt M., A primer on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), (2016); Hammer A., The rise of the machines?

One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Education; Generative AI; Human–machine collaboration","","","Tula Foundation; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (MOP 84265)","This work was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (MOP 84265) and a grant from the Tula Foundation to the Centre for Microbial Diversity and Evolution.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for scholars. Practitioner Notes 1. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 has taken higher education by storm with threats of plagiarism and integrity as key concerns. 2. We argue that effective teacher leadership is needed to develop student character so they use ChatGPT for good, rather than for personal benefit. 3. ChatGPT can create new and innovative authentic assessment in higher education. 4. ChatGPT offers students the opportunity to simplify the learning process to create less distraction, and more flow. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

Since the advent of tools based on recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), educators have made major strides in applying state-of-the-art technologies to writing classrooms. In November 2022, an AI-powered chatbot named ChatGPT capable of automatic text generation was introduced to the public. The study tried to apply ChatGPT’s text generation feature in a one-week L2 writing practicum. The study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate students’ behaviors and reflections in their exposure to ChatGPT in writing classrooms. The developmental features in learning activities and reflective perceptions were triangulated for the piloting evaluation of the impact of ChatGPT on L2 writing learners. The findings revealed the affordance and potential applicability of the tool in L2 writing pedagogy. Additionally, the tool also showcased an automatic workflow that could maximize the efficiency in composing writing. However, participants generally expressed their concern with its threats to academic honesty and educational equity. The study impelled the reconceptualization of plagiarism in the new era, development of regulatory policies and pedagogical guidance to regulate proper utilization of the tool. Being a pioneering effort, the study accentuated future research directions for more insights into the application of ChatGPT in L2 learning, and the establishment of corresponding pedagogical adjustments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","AI-enhanced education; Automatic text generation; ChatGPT; Plagiarism; Technology-enhanced writing","","","","","Adams D., Chuah K.-M., Artificial Intelligence-Based Tools in Research Writing, Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: A Practical Approach, pp. 169-184, (2022); Alshater, M, Exploring the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Enhancing Academic Performance: A Case Study of ChatGPT, SSRN Scholarly Paper, (2022); Aydin O., Karaarslan E., OpenAI ChatGPT Generated Literature Review: Digital Twin in Healthcare, SSRN Scholarly Paper, (2022); Discursive Competence in Chatgpt, Part 1: Talking with Dragons Version 2., (2023); Bikowski D., Vithanage R., Effects of web-based collaborative writing on individual L2 writing development, Language Learning & Technology, 20, 1, pp. 79-99, (2016); GPT Takes the Bar Exam, (2022); Bowen G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method, Qualitative Research Journal, 9, 2, pp. 27-40, (2009); Bowen N.E.J.A., Nanni A., Piracy, playing the system, or poor policies?

The scope of the interview was the impacts of OpenAI's GPT on higher education and academic publishing. Particularly, several questions about the impacts of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other AI-based machine learning models on the hospitality and tourism industry and education were asked. The originality of this paper derives from having the ChatGPT as an interviewee. ChatGPT stated that its use helps instructors delegate monotonous tasks such as grading and focus on more intellectual tasks, and students may utilize ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. ChatGPT confesses the risk of diminishing critical thinking for students in the case of over-reliance on ChatGPT as well as educational inequalities. For academic work, ChatGPT addressed it cannot be a substitute for human creativity and intellectuality because originality and novelty lack in outputs generated by ChatGPT.

In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date. This interview with ChatGPT is part 2 of a larger interview with ChatGPT. It provides a snapshot of the current capabilities of ChatGPT and illustrates the vast potential for medical education, research, and practice but also hints at current problems and limitations. In this conversation with Gunther Eysenbach, the founder and publisher of JMIR Publications, ChatGPT generated some ideas on how to use chatbots in medical education. It also illustrated its capabilities to generate a virtual patient simulation and quizzes for medical students; critiqued a simulated doctor-patient communication and attempts to summarize a research article (which turned out to be fabricated); commented on methods to detect machine-generated text to ensure academic integrity; generated a curriculum for health professionals to learn about artificial intelligence (AI); and helped to draft a call for papers for a new theme issue to be launched in JMIR Medical Education on ChatGPT. The conversation also highlighted the importance of proper “prompting.” Although the language generator does make occasional mistakes, it admits these when challenged. The well-known disturbing tendency of large language models to hallucinate became evident when ChatGPT fabricated references. The interview provides a glimpse into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT and the future of AI-supported medical education. Due to the impact of this new technology on medical education, JMIR Medical Education is launching a call for papers for a new e-collection and theme issue. The initial draft of the call for papers was entirely machine generated by ChatGPT, but will be edited by the human guest editors of the theme issue. ©Gunther Eysenbach.","","AI; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; future of education; generative language model; interview; medical education","","","","","Chatbots and conversational agents; ChatGPT statistics 2023: trends and the future perspectives; Gilson A, Safranek CW, Huang T, Socrates V, Chi L, Taylor RA, Et al., How does ChatGPT perform on the United States Medical Licensing Examination?

Although AI-based language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is uncertain how well they will perform in real-world scenarios, particularly in fields such as medicine where high-level and complex thinking is necessary. Furthermore, while the use of ChatGPT in writing scientific articles and other scientific outputs may have potential benefits, important ethical concerns must also be addressed. Consequently, we investigated the feasibility of ChatGPT in clinical and research scenarios: (1) support of the clinical practice, (2) scientific production, (3) misuse in medicine and research, and (4) reasoning about public health topics. Results indicated that it is important to recognize and promote education on the appropriate use and potential pitfalls of AI-based LLMs in medicine. © 2023, The Author(s).","Delivery of Health Care; Educational Status; Feasibility Studies; Health Status; Humans; Language; article; artificial intelligence; clinical practice; education; feasibility study; human; human experiment; language; public health; reasoning; thinking; writing; educational status; feasibility study; health care delivery; health status; language","Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Clinical resaerch; Medicine","","","Università degli Studi di Parma, UNIPR","No funds, grants, or other support was received.

These technologies and digital tools have been explored in terms of their affordances and their limitations during implementation in teaching practices. Teachers have actively worked to balance how a technology serves as a vehicle for learning against the challenges that are introduced through its implementation. In recent years, due to our increased reliance on digital tools and online learning environments, our education communities have first railed against, and then rallied for, each appearance of a new website, tool or platform. Whilst initial reactions can be negative (such as that recently observed on the appearance of the artificial intelligence (AI) based chatbot tool ChatGPT), many teachers will progress towards adoption of technologies in their practices once the affordances have been teased out. In some ways, as an analogy, teaching practice could be considered as an equilibrium reaction responding to the pressures of change. In this Editorial, I recognise that teachers are adaptive and creative therefore research that evidences authentic practice using AI to support student learning will increase. In parallel, as a journal, we are facing new challenges relating to the role of AI in authorship and peer review, most publishers are grappling with establishing their position on any authorship that involves AI generated text. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Review","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151869094"

The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt. However, there is a growing concern about its ethical and legal implications, and further consensus is needed for the safe and responsible implementation of AI in dental education. © 2023 by the authors.","","AI; AI academic implementation; AI detectors; AI plagiarism; ChatGPT; dentistry; education curriculum; generative AI; health professions; Midjourney","","","Kultúrna a Edukacná Grantová Agentúra MŠVVaŠ SR, KEGA, (054UK-4/2023)","This research was funded by KEGA, grant number 054UK-4/2023.","Dawood A., Marti B.M., Sauret-Jackson V., Darwood A., 3D Printing in Dentistry, Br.

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. © 2023 The Authors","Commerce; Ethical technology; Information management; ChatGPT; Conversational agents; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; In-field; Intelligent tools; Language model; Large language model; Marketing information system; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Marketing","ChatGPT; Conversational agent; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language models","","","","","Abdulquadri A., Mogaji E., Kieu T., Nguyen P., Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Adams M., (2023); Adams T., Daniel Kahneman: ‘Clearly AI is going to win.

Rapid shifts to synchronous and asynchronous online delivery modes reshaped classrooms built upon frequent peer review and student collaboration in writing, forcing students and faculty into educational technologies that raised issues of privacy, equity, and surveillance. Yet, digital writing faculty responded to these challenges in ways that prioritised individual autonomy of student writers with creative assessments, improved access to texts, thoughtful connections to employers and audiences beyond the academy, and enhanced classroom collaborations via digital technologies. As this Editorial explores, the story of digital writing pedagogy during the pandemic became the story of a constant push and pull with the technologies that created digital writing itself. And just as teachers of digital writing began to emerge from the disruptions of the pandemic, a new wave of digital writing technologies enter the mix: AI-powered writing generators have arrived via applications such as ChatGPT with the seeming potential to shape the role of digital literacy once again. As this Editorial argues, the technologies of digital writing can be harnessed to reflect the values of education – openness, individual autonomy, and the power of knowledge – but only when the practitioners of digital writing pedagogy understand and access digital writing tools. At this time, those tools are again in rapid flux and the digital writing landscape remains profoundly unsettled. Practitioner Notes 1. The shift to online teaching during the pandemic affected the teaching of digital writing, leading to better practices for integrating synchronous learning technologies (e.g., Zoom). 2. Practitioners should be alert to equity and access issues and deliberate in engaging digital teaching platforms, evaluating how they affect collaboration, peer interaction, and student autonomy. 3. Practitioners should consider specifically whether teaching and assessment tools have a history of decentring and dehumanizing students. 4. The principles of promoting collaboration and peer review in digital writing classrooms should be retained in a post-pandemic classroom. 5. Emerging from the pandemic, the teaching of digital writing faces potentially profound literacy changes from the emergence of artificial intelligence writing generators. © 2023, University of Wollongong.
