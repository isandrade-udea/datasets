The history and principles behind ChatGPT and similar models are discussed. This technology is then discussed in relation to its potential impact on academia and scholarly research and publishing. ChatGPT is seen as a potential model for the automated preparation of essays and other types of scholarly manuscripts. Potential ethical issues that could arise with the emergence of large language models like GPT-3, the underlying technology behind ChatGPT, and its usage by academics and researchers, are discussed and situated within the context of broader advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing for research and scholarly publishing. © 2023 Association for Information Science and Technology.","Computational linguistics; Ethical technology; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Publishing; Chatbots; Language model; Language processing; Natural languages; Potential impacts; Potential modeling; Research papers; Scholarly publishing; Scholarly research; Similar models; Artificial intelligence","","","","","","Abd-Elaal E., Gamage S., Mills J.E., Assisting academics to identify computer generated writing, European Journal of Engineering Education, 47, 5, pp. 725-745, (2022); Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., An overview of chatbot technology, IFIP international conference on artificial intelligence applications and innovations, pp. 373-383, (2020); Adamopoulou E., Moussiades L., Chatbots: History, technology, and applications, Machine Learning with Applications, 2, (2020); Alutto J.A., Final report of the AACSB international impact of research task force, (2008); Tenure; Anderson N., Belavy D.L., Perle S.M., Hendricks S., Hespanhol L., Verhagen E., Memon A.R., AI did not write this manuscript, or did it?

We asked the chatbot to respond to a basic physics question that will be familiar to most physics teachers: ‘A teddy bear is thrown into the air. What is its acceleration in the highest point?’ The chatbot’s responses, while linguistically quite advanced, were unreliable in their correctness and often full of contradictions. We then attempted to engage in Socratic dialogue with the chatbot to resolve the errors and contradictions, but with little success. We found that ChatGPT is not yet good enough to be used as a cheating tool for physics students or as a physics tutor. However, we found it quite reliable in generating incorrect responses on which physics teachers could train assessment of student responses. © 2023 The Author(s).

Recently, OpenAI Inc. has launched a new chatbot, called ChatGPT that interacts in a conversational way and its dialogue format makes is user friendly and fast. In this paper we aimed to explore the current position and the accuracy of currently available version of ChatGPT in relation to healthcare and medical research. Methods: We searched the PubMed, Scopus, and Google databases from 15th to 25th February 2023, using the keywords: ‘ChatGPT’ AND ‘medical research, healthcare, and scientific writing’. We found 29 results in PubMed and 9 results in Scopus database., in English language. In addition, we (RV, AM) interacted with ChatGPT multiple times to review accuracy of responses of various medical questions. Results: Using literature search and interactions with ChatGPT with medical questions, we infer that this version generates answers rapidly but narrates data from existing internet literature in a general manner. However, as emphasised by the company in the landing page of ChatGPT, we found errors in responses to medical questions, Further, narrated data were limited up to September 2021. Positive features include admission of its limitations in medical field, and as it has been designed, learning from previous answers. Conclusion: Current version of ChatGPT may be useful in a limited manner as a narrative AI chatbot for medical personnel, however, researchers are advised to fact check all statements provided, keeping in mind its limitations. © 2023 Research Trust of DiabetesIndia (DiabetesIndia) and National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation (N-DOC)","Article; artificial intelligence; data accuracy; English (language); health care; human; Internet; medical literature; medical research; Medline; misinformation; publication; Scopus; search engine","Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Healthcare; Research","","","","","Optimizing language models for dialogue; Hutson M., Could AI help you to write your next paper?, Nature Nov, 192, 611, pp. 192-193, (2022); Yampolskiy R.V., Exploring Machine Ethics and AI Safety: A Comprehensive Overview.

The underlying technology is key to further innovations and, despite critical views and even bans within communities and regions, large language models are here to stay. This commentary presents the potential benefits and challenges of educational applications of large language models, from student and teacher perspectives. We briefly discuss the current state of large language models and their applications. We then highlight how these models can be used to create educational content, improve student engagement and interaction, and personalize learning experiences. With regard to challenges, we argue that large language models in education require teachers and learners to develop sets of competencies and literacies necessary to both understand the technology as well as their limitations and unexpected brittleness of such systems. In addition, a clear strategy within educational systems and a clear pedagogical approach with a strong focus on critical thinking and strategies for fact checking are required to integrate and take full advantage of large language models in learning settings and teaching curricula. Other challenges such as the potential bias in the output, the need for continuous human oversight, and the potential for misuse are not unique to the application of AI in education. But we believe that, if handled sensibly, these challenges can offer insights and opportunities in education scenarios to acquaint students early on with potential societal biases, criticalities, and risks of AI applications. We conclude with recommendations for how to address these challenges and ensure that such models are used in a responsible and ethical manner in education. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","","Artificial intelligence; Education; Educational technologies; Large language models","","","","","Abdelghani R., Wang Y.-H., Yuan X., Wang T., Sauzeon H., Oudeyer P.-Y., GPT-3-driven pedagogical agents for training children's curious question-asking skills, (2022); Ahuja A.S., Polascik B.W., Doddapaneni D., Byrnes E.S., Sridhar J., The digital metaverse: Applications in artificial intelligence, medical education, and integrative health, Integrative Medicine Research, 12, 1, (2023); Ayanwale M.A., Sanusi I.T., Adelana O.P., Aruleba K.D., Oyelere S.S., Teachers’ readiness and intention to teach artificial intelligence in schools, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, (2022); Bao M., Can home use of speech-enabled artificial intelligence mitigate foreign language anxiety–investigation of a concept, Arab World English Journal (AWEJ), Special Issue on CALL, (2019); Becker B.A., Denny P., Finnie-Ansley J., Luxton-Reilly A., Prather J., Santos E.A., Programming is hard–or at least it used to be: Educational opportunities and challenges of ai code generation, (2022); Bernius J.P., Krusche S., Bruegge B., Machine learning based feedback on textual student answers in large courses.

Brint Ryan College of Business, University of North Texas, Denton, 76201, TX, United States","To better understand the role of artificial intelligence in the development of entrepreneurial rhetoric, we examine how generative language models such as ChatGPT serve as viable tools for content creation. Using an established framework for examining CEO celebrity (Creator, Transformer, Rebel, and Savior), we illustrate how such models can effectively produce and refine elevator pitches, social media pitches, and crowdfunding pitches commonly used in the study of entrepreneurial rhetoric. We demonstrate ChatGPT's ability to mimic each celebrity CEO archetype by prompting language in the style of exemplars, including Elon Musk, Indra Nooyi, Tony Hsieh, and Lisa Su. Implications of prompt engineering—the fine-tuning of inputs fed into language models to produce precise output—for entrepreneurship research and practice are discussed. We conclude by advancing the idea that the emergent and enduring value of generative models is, at its core, dependent on effective prompt engineering. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","","Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Content analysis; Crowdfunding; Elevator pitch; Prompt engineering","","","","","Allison T.H., Davis B.C., Webb J.W., Short J.C., Persuasion in crowdfunding: an elaboration likelihood model of crowdfunding performance, J.

One recent phenomenon is ChatGPT, a chatbot with a conversational artificial intelligence interface that was developed by OpenAI. As one of the most advanced artificial intelligence applications, ChatGPT has drawn much public attention across the globe. In this regard, this study examines ChatGPT in education, among early adopters, through a qualitative instrumental case study. Conducted in three stages, the first stage of the study reveals that the public discourse in social media is generally positive and there is enthusiasm regarding its use in educational settings. However, there are also voices who are approaching cautiously using ChatGPT in educational settings. The second stage of the study examines the case of ChatGPT through lenses of educational transformation, response quality, usefulness, personality and emotion, and ethics. In the third and final stage of the study, the investigation of user experiences through ten educational scenarios revealed various issues, including cheating, honesty and truthfulness of ChatGPT, privacy misleading, and manipulation. The findings of this study provide several research directions that should be considered to ensure a safe and responsible adoption of chatbots, specifically ChatGPT, in education. © 2023, The Author(s).","","Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Education; Generative AI; Human–machine collaboration","","","Tula Foundation; Canadian Institutes of Health Research, CIHR, (MOP 84265)","This work was supported by a grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research (MOP 84265) and a grant from the Tula Foundation to the Centre for Microbial Diversity and Evolution.

The aim of the review was to evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of current AI-based systems compared to conventional methods in diagnosing, assessing the progress of patients’ treatment and follow-up stability. The researchers used various online databases and identified diagnostic software and dental monitoring software as the most studied software in contemporary orthodontics. The former can accurately identify anatomical landmarks used for cephalometric analysis, while the latter enables orthodontists to thoroughly monitor each patient, determine specific desired outcomes, track progress, and warn of potential changes in pre-existing pathology. However, there is limited evidence to assess the stability of treatment outcomes and relapse detection. The study concludes that AI is an effective tool for managing orthodontic treatment from diagnosis to retention, benefiting both patients and clinicians. Patients find the software easy to use and feel better cared for, while clinicians can make diagnoses more easily and assess compliance and damage to braces or aligners more quickly and frequently. © 2023 by the authors.","","AI; AI Treatment Assessment; ChatGPT; orthodontics; Teledentistry Cephalometrics","","","Slovak Grant Agency for Science KEGA, (054UK-4/2023)","This work was supported by the Slovak Grant Agency for Science KEGA Thurzo—grant No. 054UK-4/2023.","Tokgoz P., Stampa S., Wahnert D., Vordemvenne T., Dockweiler C., Virtual Reality in the Rehabilitation of Patients with Injuries and Diseases of Upper Extremities, Healthcare, 10, (2022); Giansanti D., Artificial Intelligence in Public Health: Current Trends and Future Possibilities, Int.

ChatGPT is a type of chatbot, developed by OpenAI, that uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model to understand and respond to natural language inputs. AI chatbot and ChatGPT in particular appear to be useful tools in scientific writing, assisting researchers and scientists in organizing material, generating an initial draft and/or in proofreading. There is no publication in the field of critical care medicine prepared using this approach; however, this will be a possibility in the next future. ChatGPT work should not be used as a replacement for human judgment and the output should always be reviewed by experts before being used in any critical decision-making or application. Moreover, several ethical issues arise about using these tools, such as the risk of plagiarism and inaccuracies, as well as a potential imbalance in its accessibility between high- and low-income countries, if the software becomes paying. For this reason, a consensus on how to regulate the use of chatbots in scientific writing will soon be required. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Writing; Article; artificial intelligence; consensus; data accuracy; data quality; decision making; high income country; information processing; information source; intensive care medicine; low income country; machine learning; plagiarism; publication; research ethics; scientific literature; scientist; human; writing","Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; Machine learning; Scientific writing","","","","","King M.R., The future of AI in medicine: a perspective from a Chatbot, Ann Biomed Eng, 51, pp. 291-295, (2022); Hutson M., Could AI help you to write your next paper?, Nature Nature Research, 611, pp. 192-193, (2022); Suverein M.M., Delnoij T.S.R., Lorusso R., Bruinsma G.J.B.B., Otterspoor L., Kraemer C.V.E., Et al., Early extracorporeal CPR for refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, New Engl J Med, 388, pp. 299-309, (2023); Patel S.B., Lam K., ChatGPT: the future of discharge summaries?, Lancet Digit Health, (2023); Else H., Abstracts written by ChatGPT fool scientists, Nature, 613, (2023); Gao C.A., Howard F.M., Markov N.S., Dyer E.C., Ramesh S., Luo Y., Et al., Comparing scientific abstracts generated by ChatGPT to original abstracts using an artificial intelligence output detector, plagiarism detector, and blinded human reviewers, BioRxiv, (2022); Hammad M., The impact of artificial intelligence (AI) Programs on writing scientific research, Ann Biomed Eng, 51, pp. 459-460, (2023)","","","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149053491"

A total of 233,914 English tweets were analyzed using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling algorithm to answer the question “what can ChatGPT do?”. The results revealed three general topics: news, technology, and reactions. The author also identified five functional domains: creative writing, essay writing, prompt writing, code writing, and answering questions. The analysis also found that ChatGPT has the potential to impact technologies and humans in both positive and negative ways. In conclusion, the author outlines four key issues that need to be addressed as a result of this AI advancement: the evolution of jobs, a new technological landscape, the quest for artificial general intelligence, and the progress-ethics conundrum. © 2023 by the author.","Artificial intelligence; Social networking (online); AI chatbot; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Creative writings; Essay writings; Functional domains; Latent Dirichlet allocation; Topic Modeling; Topic modeling algorithms; Twitter; Statistics","AI chatbot; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; LDA; topic modeling; Twitter","","","","","ChatGPT: Optimizing Language Models for Dialogue; Thorat S.A., Jadhav V., A review on implementation issues of rule-based chatbot systems, Proceedings of the International Conference on Innovative Computing & Communications (ICICC), (2020); Xu L., Sanders L., Li K., Chow J.C., Chatbot for health care and oncology applications using artificial intelligence and machine learning: Systematic review, JMIR Cancer, 7, (2021); Nagarhalli T.P., Vaze V., Rana N., A review of current trends in the development of chatbot systems, Proceedings of the 2020 6th International Conference on Advanced Computing and Communication Systems (ICACCS), pp. 706-710; Nithuna S., Laseena C., Review on implementation techniques of chatbot, Proceedings of the 2020 International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP), pp. 157-161; Satu M.S., Parvez M.H., Review of integrated applications with aiml based chatbot, Proceedings of the 2015 International Conference on Computer and Information Engineering (ICCIE), pp. 87-90; Okonkwo C.W., Ade-Ibijola A., Chatbots applications in education: A systematic review, Comput.

Analyzing, comparing, and summarizing these achievements at the paradigm level is important for future AI innovation, but has not received sufficient attention. In this paper, we give an overview and perspective on machine learning paradigms. First, we propose a paradigm taxonomy with three levels and seven dimensions from a knowledge perspective. Accordingly, we give an overview on three basic and twelve extended learning paradigms, such as Ensemble Learning, Transfer Learning, etc., with figures in unified style. We further analyze three advanced paradigms, i.e., AlphaGo, AlphaFold and ChatGPT. Second, to enable more efficient and effective scientific discovery, we propose to build a new ecosystem that drives AI paradigm shifts through the decentralized science (DeSci) movement based on decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). To this end, we design the Hanoi framework, which integrates human factors, parallel intelligence based on a combination of artificial systems and the natural world, and the DAO to inspire AI innovations.  © 2014 Chinese Association of Automation.","ChatGPT; Decentralised; Decentralized autonomous organization; Decentralized science; Learning paradigms; Machine-learning; On-machines; Paradigm shifts; Three-level; Machine learning","ChatGPT; decentralized autonomous organization (DAO); decentralized science (DeSci); machine learning; paradigm shift","","","","","McCulloch W.S., Pitts W., A logical calculus of the ideas immanent in nervous activity, The bulletin of mathematical biophysics, 5, pp. 115-133, (1943); Silver D., Huang A., Maddison C.J., Guez A., Sifre L., Driessche Den G.Van, Schrittwieser J., Antonoglou I., Panneershelvam V., Lanctot M., Dieleman S., Grewe D., Nham J., Kalchbrenner N., Sutskever I., Lillicrap T., Leach M., Kavukcuoglu K., Graepel T., Hassabis D., Mastering the game of Go with deep neural networks and tree search, Nature, 529, 7587, pp. 484-489, (2016); Ouyang L., Wu J., Jiang X., Et al., Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback, arXiv, (2022); Chaslot G., Bakkes S., Szita I., Spronck P., Montecarlo tree search: A new framework for game ai, Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment, 4, 1, pp. 216-217, (2008); Kuhn T.S., The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, (1962); Sutton R.S., Barto A.G., Reinforcement learning: An introduction, (2018); Xi J., Zhu F., Ye P., Lv Y., Tang H., Wang F.-Y., Hmdrl: Hierarchical mixed deep reinforcement learning to balance vehicle supply and demand, IEEE Transactions On Intelligent Transportation Systems, 23, 11, pp. 21861-21872, (2022); Xia L., Li Q., Song R., Modares H., Optimal Synchronization Control of Heterogeneous Asymmetric Input-Constrained Unknown Nonlinear MASs via Reinforcement Learning, IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 9, 3, pp. 520-532, (2022); Dietterich T.G., Ensemble methods in machine learning, International Workshop on Multiple Classifier Systems, (2000); Mienye I.D., Sun Y., A survey of ensemble learning: Concepts, algorithms, applications, and prospects, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 99129-99149, (2022); Simon H.A., Lea G., Problem solving and rule induction: A unified view, Knowledge and cognition, pp. 105-127, (1974); Settles B., Active learning literature survey, (2009); Bengio Y., Louradour J., Collobert R., Weston J., Curriculum learning, Proceedings of the 26th annual international conference on machine learning, pp. 41-48, (2009); Wang X., Chen Y., Zhu W., A survey on curriculum learning, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, (2021); Caruana R., Multitask Learning, Machine Learning, 28, 1, pp. 41-75, (1997); Collobert R., Weston J., A unified architecture for natural language processing: Deep neural networks with multitask learning, Proceedings of the 25th international conference on Machine learning, pp. 160-167, (2008); Pratt L.Y., Discriminability-Based Transfer between Neural Networks, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 5, (1992); Zhuang F., Qi Z., Duan K., Et al., A comprehensive survey on transfer learning, Proceedings of the IEEE, 109, 1, pp. 43-76, (2020); Hospedales T., Antoniou A., Micaelli P., Et al., Metalearning in neural networks: A survey, IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence, 44, 9, pp. 5149-5169, (2021); Tian Y., Zhao X., Huang W., Meta-learning approaches for learning-to-learn in deep learning: A survey, Neurocomputing, 494, pp. 203-223, (2022); Thrun S., Mitchell T.M., Lifelong robot learning, Robotics and autonomous systems, 15, 1-2, pp. 25-46, (1995); Chen Z., Liu B., Lifelong machine learning, Synthesis Lectures on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 12, 3, pp. 1-207, (2018); Becker S., Hinton G.E., Self-organizing neural network that discovers surfaces in random-dot stereograms, Nature, 355, 6356, pp. 161-163, (1992); Chen T., Kornblith S., Norouzi M., Hinton G., A simple framework for contrastive learning of visual representations, International conference on machine learning.

It is essential to pinpoint the most pressing and important research questions. To evaluate the potential of chatGPT for identifying research priorities in GI and provide a starting point for further investigation. We queried chatGPT on four key topics in GI: inflammatory bowel disease, microbiome, Artificial Intelligence in GI, and advanced endoscopy in GI. A panel of experienced gastroenterologists separately reviewed and rated the generated research questions on a scale of 1–5, with 5 being the most important and relevant to current research in GI. chatGPT generated relevant and clear research questions. Yet, the questions were not considered original by the panel of gastroenterologists. On average, the questions were rated 3.6 ± 1.4, with inter-rater reliability ranging from 0.80 to 0.98 (p < 0.001). The mean grades for relevance, clarity, specificity, and originality were 4.9 ± 0.1, 4.6 ± 0.4, 3.1 ± 0.2, 1.5 ± 0.4, respectively. Our study suggests that Large Language Models (LLMs) may be a useful tool for identifying research priorities in the field of GI, but more work is needed to improve the novelty of the generated research questions. © 2023, The Author(s).","Artificial Intelligence; Gastroenterologists; Gastroenterology; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Reproducibility of Results; artificial intelligence; gastroenterologist; gastroenterology; human; inflammatory bowel disease; reproducibility","","","","","","Klang E., Soffer S., Tsur A., Shachar E., Lahat A., Innovation in gastroenterology—Can we do better?, Biomimetics (Basel), 7, 1, (2022); About Openai.; Milne-Ives M., de Cock C., Lim E., Shehadeh M.H., de Pennington N., Mole G., Normando E., Meinert E., The effectiveness of artificial intelligence conversational agents in health care: Systematic review, J.

ChatGPT is a recently developed LLM that was trained on a massive dataset of text for dialogue with users. Although AI-based language models like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is uncertain how well they will perform in real-world scenarios, particularly in fields such as medicine where high-level and complex thinking is necessary. Furthermore, while the use of ChatGPT in writing scientific articles and other scientific outputs may have potential benefits, important ethical concerns must also be addressed. Consequently, we investigated the feasibility of ChatGPT in clinical and research scenarios: (1) support of the clinical practice, (2) scientific production, (3) misuse in medicine and research, and (4) reasoning about public health topics.

To do this, we conducted an analysis using GPT-3 in order to explore the benefits of AI for digitalization, urbanization, globalization, climate change, automation and mobility, global health issues, and the aging population. We also looked at emerging markets as well as sustainability in this study. Interaction with GPT-3 was conducted solely through prompt questions, and generated responses were analyzed. Our results indicate that AI can significantly improve our understanding of these megatrends by providing insights into how they develop over time and which solutions could be implemented. Further research is needed to determine how effective AI will be in addressing them successfully, but initial findings are encouraging. Our discussion focuses on the implications of our findings for society going forward and suggests that further investigation should be conducted into how best to utilize new technologies such as GPT-3 when tackling these challenges. Lastly, we conclude that, while there is still much work left to do before any tangible effects can be seen from utilizing AI tools such as GPT-3 on societal megatrends, early indications suggest it may have a positive impact if used correctly. © 2023 by the authors.","","artificial intelligence; automation; chatbots; ChatGPT; collaboration; digital health; global trends; GPT-3; human–AI interaction; OpenAI; technological advancement","","","Austrian Science Fund, FWF, (P 33099-N)","This research and Open Access was partly funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF), grant number P 33099-N.","Jeflea F.V., Danciulescu D., Sitnikov C.S., Filipeanu D., Park J.O., Tugui A., Societal Technological Megatrends: A Bibliometric Analysis from 1982 to 2021, Sustainability, 14, (2022); Hessel V., Megatrends—Megascience?, Green Process.

In principle, these results should be generalisable across research domains. There are clear advantages for idea generation and data identification. The technology, however, is weaker on literature synthesis and developing appropriate testing frameworks. Importantly, we further demonstrate that the extent of private data and researcher domain expertise input, are key factors in determining the quality of output.

The potential applications of LLMs in health care education, research, and practice could be promising if the associated valid concerns are proactively examined and addressed. The current systematic review aimed to investigate the utility of ChatGPT in health care education, research, and practice and to highlight its potential limitations. Using the PRIMSA guidelines, a systematic search was conducted to retrieve English records in PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar (published research or preprints) that examined ChatGPT in the context of health care education, research, or practice. A total of 60 records were eligible for inclusion. Benefits of ChatGPT were cited in 51/60 (85.0%) records and included: (1) improved scientific writing and enhancing research equity and versatility; (2) utility in health care research (efficient analysis of datasets, code generation, literature reviews, saving time to focus on experimental design, and drug discovery and development); (3) benefits in health care practice (streamlining the workflow, cost saving, documentation, personalized medicine, and improved health literacy); and (4) benefits in health care education including improved personalized learning and the focus on critical thinking and problem-based learning. Concerns regarding ChatGPT use were stated in 58/60 (96.7%) records including ethical, copyright, transparency, and legal issues, the risk of bias, plagiarism, lack of originality, inaccurate content with risk of hallucination, limited knowledge, incorrect citations, cybersecurity issues, and risk of infodemics. The promising applications of ChatGPT can induce paradigm shifts in health care education, research, and practice. However, the embrace of this AI chatbot should be conducted with extreme caution considering its potential limitations. As it currently stands, ChatGPT does not qualify to be listed as an author in scientific articles unless the ICMJE/COPE guidelines are revised or amended. An initiative involving all stakeholders in health care education, research, and practice is urgently needed. This will help to set a code of ethics to guide the responsible use of ChatGPT among other LLMs in health care and academia. © 2023 by the author.","","artificial intelligence; digital health; ethics; healthcare; machine learning","","","","","Sarker I.H., AI-Based Modeling: Techniques, Applications and Research Issues Towards Automation, Intelligent and Smart Systems, SN Comput.

With consistent moral advice, it can improve the moral judgment and decisions of users. Unfortunately, ChatGPT's advice is not consistent. Nonetheless, it does influence users' moral judgment, we find in an experiment, even if they know they are advised by a chatting bot, and they underestimate how much they are influenced. Thus, ChatGPT corrupts rather than improves its users' moral judgment. While these findings call for better design of ChatGPT and similar bots, we also propose training to improve users' digital literacy as a remedy.

Built by OpenAI, which is also responsible for the breakthrough image generator, DALL-E, ChatGPT is an LLM (large language model) tool that uses deep learning techniques to generate text in response to questions posed to it. It can generate essays, email, song lyrics, recipes, computer code, webpages, even games and medical diagnoses. Rather than search the internet, ChatGPT has been trained on a large corpus of text, including news articles, books, websites, academic articles, and other sources. The current corpus includes data from multiple languages and computer codes. The generation of text is accomplished by predicting the next word in a series of words to produce sentences and then entire pages of content. © 2023 Christopher Cox and Elias Tzoc.","","","","","","","Alexander Bryan, Resources for exploring ChatGPT and higher education, Brian Alexander, (2022); Microsoft integrated AI into its Bing search engine, contrast to ChatGPT, Bing’s AI can include results from the internet, (2023); The Sentient Syllabus Project; Understanding AI Writing Tools and their Uses for Teaching and Learning at UC Berkeley; Belkin Douglas, Professors Turn to ChatGPT to Teach Students a Lesson: The Powerful Paper-Writing Chatbot Presents an Educational Challenge: Ban It or Build On It?, Wall Street Journal, (2023); Johnson Hunter, 4 Ways Devs can Use ChatGPT to Be More Productive, Educative (blog), (2023); Tools Such as ChatGPT Threaten Transparent Science; Here Are Our Ground Rules for Their Use, editorial, Nature, 612, 7945, (2023); Wiley David, AI, Instructional Design, and OER, Improving Learning (blog), (2023)","","","","","","","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150045136"

Manufacturers achieve competitive advantage by sustaining continuous production, which can be realised through Condition-based Maintenance and Prognostics and Health Management. Hereby, the machine's health can be predicted, and post-prognostics decision-making allows to optimise PPC to meet customer demands and minimise costs. Unfortunately, the complex dynamic, stochastic and intransparent nature of post-prognostics PPC makes it intractable to use ‘traditional’ static or deterministic optimisation techniques or approaches that require an exact mathematical model or objective function. To tackle this, a data-driven post-prognostics Reinforcement Learning model is developed to plan and control the sourcing of spare parts, production, and maintenance of a single-machine production system to maximise production revenue by meeting customer demands and minimising costs. In a case study, Proximal Policy Optimisation, which is well-known from OpenAI's ChatGPT, is applied to a post-prognostics PPC decision-making problem. The Proximal Policy Optimisation is compared to other state-of-the-art learners, and the performance and robustness are evaluated. Analyses show that our model outperforms other learners, as well as reactive and scheduled preventive maintenance strategies and is robust to noise and cost changes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Condition based maintenance;

The top 10 contribution areas of AI towards public health were gathered in this exploratory study. We utilized the “text-davinci-003” model of GPT-3, using OpenAI playground default parameters. The model was trained with the largest training dataset any AI had, limited to a cut-off date in 2021. This study aimed to test the ability of GPT-3 to advance public health and to explore the feasibility of using AI as a scientific co-author. We asked the AI asked for structured input, including scientific quotations, and reviewed responses for plausibility. We found that GPT-3 was able to assemble, summarize, and generate plausible text blocks relevant for public health concerns, elucidating valuable areas of application for itself. However, most quotations were purely invented by GPT-3 and thus invalid. Our research showed that AI can contribute to public health research as a team member. According to authorship guidelines, the AI was ultimately not listed as a co-author, as it would be done with a human researcher. We conclude that good scientific practice also needs to be followed for AI contributions, and a broad scientific discourse on AI contributions is needed. © 2023 by the authors.","Artificial Intelligence; Data Analysis; Humans; Knowledge; Parks, Recreational; Public Health; artificial intelligence; automation; public health; technological development; Article; artificial intelligence; decision making; exploratory research; health care policy; information dissemination; public health; public health message; data analysis; human; knowledge; recreational park","artificial intelligence; automation; chatbots; ChatGPT; collaboration; digital health; GPT-3; human-AI interaction; open science; OpenAI; technological advancement","","","","","Chan A., GPT-3 and InstructGPT: Technological dystopianism, utopianism, and “Contextual” perspectives in AI ethics and industry, AI Ethics, 3, pp. 1-12, (2022); Thunstrom A.O., Steingrimsson S., Can GPT-3 write an academic paper on itself, with minimal human input? 2022; Giansanti D., Artificial Intelligence in Public Health: Current Trends and Future Possibilities, Int.

BERT, T5, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Codex, DALL-E, Whisper, and CLIP are now the foundation for new applications ranging from computer vision to protein sequence study and from speech recognition to coding. Earlier models had a reputation of starting from scratch with each new challenge. The capacity to experiment with, examine, and comprehend the capabilities and potentials of next-generation FMs is critical to undertaking this research and guiding its path. Nevertheless, these models are currently inaccessible as the resources required to train these models are highly concentrated in industry, and even the assets (data, code) required to replicate their training are frequently not released due to their demand in the real-time industry. At the moment, only large tech companies such as OpenAI, Google, Facebook, and Baidu can afford to construct FMs. We attempt to analyze and examine the main capabilities, key implementations, technological fundamentals, and socially constructed possible consequences of these models inside this research. Despite the expected widely publicized use of FMs, we still lack a comprehensive knowledge of how they operate, why they underperform, and what they are even capable of because of their emerging global qualities. To deal with these problems, we believe that much critical research on FMs would necessitate extensive multidisciplinary collaboration, given their essentially social and technical structure. Throughout the investigation, we will also have to deal with the problem of misrepresentation created by these systems. If FMs live up to their promise, AI might see far wider commercial use. As researchers studying the ramifications on society, we believe FMs will lead the way in massive changes. They are closely managed for the time being, so we should have time to comprehend their implications before they become a major concern. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Codes (symbols); Foundations; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Speech recognition; Supervised learning; Context learning; Fine tuning; Foundation model in robotic; Foundation models; Images processing; In contexts; In-context learning; Language processing; Machine learning models; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Pre-trained model; Self-attention; Self-supervised learning; Transfer learning; Transformer; Computer vision","Computer vision; Fine-tuning; Foundation models in robotics; Image processing; In-context learning; Machine learning models; Natural Language Processing; Pre-trained models; Self-attention; Self-supervised learning; Transfer learning; Transformers","","","","","Sapunov G., Foundation models, (2021); Rosso C., AI's paradigm shift to foundation models, (2021); Devlin J., Chang M.-W., Lee K., Toutanova K., Bert: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, (2018); Raffel C., Shazeer N., Roberts A., Lee K., Narang S., Matena M., Zhou Y., Li W., Liu P.J., Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text transformer, J.

These chatbots can be integrated into messaging apps, mobile apps, or websites, and are designed to engage in natural language conversations with users. There are also many applications in which chatbots are used for educational support to improve students’ performance during the learning cycle. The recent success of ChatGPT also encourages researchers to explore more possibilities in the field of chatbot applications. One of the main benefits of conversational chatbots is their ability to provide an instant and automated response, which can be leveraged in many application areas. Chatbots can handle a wide range of inquiries and tasks, such as answering frequently asked questions, booking appointments, or making recommendations. Modern conversational chatbots use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP) and artificial neural networks, to understand and respond to users’ input. In this study, we will explore the objectives of why chatbot systems were built and what key methodologies and datasets were leveraged to build a chatbot. Finally, the achievement of the objectives will be discussed, as well as the associated challenges and future chatbot development trends. © 2023 by the authors.","artificial intelligence; data processing; implementation process; Internet; language; literature review; machine learning; methodology; software","chatbot; conversational agents; conversational chatbot; dialogue generation; dialogue response; dialogue strategies; dialogue system; machine learning","","","National Science and Technology Council, NSTC, (109-2511-H-008-007-MY3, 111-2410-H-008-010-MY3)","This research was funded by National Science and Technology Council grant number 111-2410-H-008-010-MY3 and 109-2511-H-008-007-MY3.

Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”). © 2023 The Authors","","Academic integrity; Bard; ChatGPT; Critical analysis; DALL-E; Education; Educator; Ethics; Future of education; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Google; Management education; Management educator; OpenAI; Paradox; Paradox theory; Ragnarök; Reformation; Transformation; Transformative education","","","","","Queensland to join NSW in banning access to ChatGPT in state schools, ABC News, (2023); Ali F., Let the devil speak for itself: Should ChatGPT be allowed or banned in hospitality and tourism schools?, Journal of Global Hospitality and Tourism, 2, 1, pp. 1-6, (2023); Alt D., Students' social media engagement and fear of missing out (FoMO) in a diverse classroom, Journal of Computing in Higher Education, 29, 2, pp. 388-410, (2017); Principles for ethical use of personalized student data, (2020); Brehm J.W., Psychological reactance: Theory and applications, Advances in Consumer Research, 16, pp. 72-75, (1989); Why we fall for fake news, (2023); Chatterjee J., Dethlefs N., This new conversational AI model can be your friend, philosopher, and guide … and even your worst enemy, Pattern, 4, 1, (2023); Cheddadi S., Bouache M., Improving equity and access to higher education using artificial intelligence, The 16th international Conference on computer science & education (ICCSE 2021), pp. 18-20, (2021); Dencik L., Sanchez-Monedero J., Data justice, Internet Policy Review, 11, 1, pp. 1-16, (2022); Dibble M., Schools ban ChatGPT amid fears of artificial intelligence-assisted cheating, (2023); Dowling M., Lucey B., ChatGPT for (finance) research: The Bananarama conjecture, Finance Research Letters, (2023); Fatemi G., Saito E., Unintentional plagiarism and academic integrity: The challenges and needs of postgraduate international students in Australia, Journal of Further and Higher Education, 44, 10, pp. 1305-1319, (2020); Ferraro C., Wheeler M.A., Pallant J.I., Wilson S.G., Oldmeadow J., Not so ‘trustless’ after all: Trust in Web3 technology and opportunities for brands, Business Horizons, (2023); Hair J.F., Hult G.T.M., Ringle C.M., Sarstedt M., A primer on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), (2016); Hammer A., The rise of the machines?

The scope of the interview was the impacts of OpenAI's GPT on higher education and academic publishing. Particularly, several questions about the impacts of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other AI-based machine learning models on the hospitality and tourism industry and education were asked. The originality of this paper derives from having the ChatGPT as an interviewee. ChatGPT stated that its use helps instructors delegate monotonous tasks such as grading and focus on more intellectual tasks, and students may utilize ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas. ChatGPT confesses the risk of diminishing critical thinking for students in the case of over-reliance on ChatGPT as well as educational inequalities. For academic work, ChatGPT addressed it cannot be a substitute for human creativity and intellectuality because originality and novelty lack in outputs generated by ChatGPT. The tourism and hospitality industry can benefit from ChatGPT for certain things such as personalized services, content creation, and many more. © 2023 The Author(s).","","Academic publishing; AI tools; ChatGPT; Education; Natural language processing; Open AI; Pre-trained data; Tourism and Hospitality","","","","","AlphaGo.

Franklin Street, Denver, 80218, CO, United States","We present a Socratic dialogue with ChatGPT, a large language model (LLM), on the causal interpretation of epidemiological associations between fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and human mortality risks. ChatGPT, reflecting probable patterns of human reasoning and argumentation in the sources on which it has been trained, initially holds that “It is well-established that exposure to ambient levels of PM2.5 does increase mortality risk” and adds the unsolicited remark that “Reducing exposure to PM2.5 is an important public health priority.” After patient questioning, however, it concludes that “It is not known with certainty that current ambient levels of PM2.5 increase mortality risk. While there is strong evidence of an association between PM2.5 and mortality risk, the causal nature of this association remains uncertain due to the possibility of omitted confounders.” This revised evaluation of the evidence suggests the potential value of sustained questioning in refining and improving both the types of human reasoning and argumentation imitated by current LLMs and the reliability of the initial conclusions expressed by current LLMs. © 2023 The Author","","Causal artificial intelligence; Causal reasoning; ChatGPT; Large language models; PM2.5","","","American Chemistry Council, ACC; Anglo-Israel Association, AIA","The author thanks George Maldonado and an anonymous reviewer for very thoughtful comments and suggestions on an early draft of this paper. McKee Poland suggested several excellent ideas after reading the dialogue, including using a collection of AIs to improve each others' reasoning. Vishnu Vardhan Guttikonda and Shubham Singh helped build an early version of an AI Causal Research Assistant (AIA) program that informed the comments in the Reflections and Conclusions section. Rick Becker and Ted Simon have been enthusiastic champions for AIA and the American Chemistry Council provided seed funding for an initial software implementation. Steve Milloy and Stan Young provided useful comments on the dialogue that suggested the contrast with human regulatory practices and raised the question of one-shot learning from dialogues.","Burns J., Boogaard H., Polus S., Pfadenhauer L.M., Rohwer A.C., van Erp A.M., Et al., Interventions to reduce ambient air pollution and their effects on health: an abridged Cochrane systematic review, Environ Int, 135, (2020); Tamkin A., Brundage M., Clark J., Ganguli D., Understanding the capabilities, limitations, and societal impact of large language models, ArXiv, (2021)","","","","","","","","Note","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150285383"

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. © 2023 The Authors","Commerce; Ethical technology; Information management; ChatGPT; Conversational agents; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; In-field; Intelligent tools; Language model; Large language model; Marketing information system; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Marketing","ChatGPT; Conversational agent; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language models","","","","","Abdulquadri A., Mogaji E., Kieu T., Nguyen P., Digital transformation in financial services provision: a Nigerian perspective to the adoption of chatbot, Journal of Enterprising Communities: People and Places in the Global Economy, 15, 2, pp. 258-281, (2021); Adams M., (2023); Adams T., Daniel Kahneman: ‘Clearly AI is going to win.

We examine the evolution of these tools, and highlight the potential ways that LLMs can support in the education of students in digital writing and beyond, including the teaching of writing and composition, the possibilities of co-creation between humans and AI, supporting EFL learners, and improving Automated Writing Evaluations (AWE). We describe and demonstrate the potential that these tools have in creating original, coherent text that can avoid detection by existing technological methods of detection and trained academic staff alike, demonstrating a major academic integrity concern related to the use of these tools by students. Analysing the various issues related to academic integrity that LLMs raise for both Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) and students, we conclude that it is not the student use of any AI tools that defines whether plagiarism or a breach of academic integrity has occurred, but whether any use is made clear by the student. Deciding whether any particular use of LLMs by students can be defined as academic misconduct is determined by the academic integrity policies of any given HEI, which must be updated to consider how these tools will be used in future educational environments. Practitioner Notes 1. Students now have easy access to advanced Artificial Intelligence based tools such as ChatGPT. These tools use Large Language Models (LLMs) and can be used to create original written content that students may use in their assessments. 2. These tools can be accessed using commercial services built on this software, often targeted to students as a means of ‘assisting’ students with assessments. 3. The output created by these LLMs is coherent enough for it not to be detected by academic staff members, or traditional text-matching software used to detect plagiarism, but falsified references may hint at their use if unchanged by students. 4. The use of these tools may not necessarily be considered as plagiarism if students are transparent in how they have been used in any submission, however it may be a breach of academic integrity policies of any given Higher Education Institution (HEI). 5. There are legitimate uses of these tools in supporting the education of students, meaning HEIs must carefully consider how policies dealing with student use of this software are created. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

We aim to demonstrate how ChatGPT could help researchers to accelerate drafting their papers. We created a simulated data set of 100 000 health care workers with varying ages, Body Mass Index (BMI), and risk profiles. Simulation data allow analysts to test statistical analysis techniques, such as machine-learning based approaches, without compromising patient privacy. Infections were simulated with a randomized probability of hospitalisation. A subset of these fictitious people was vaccinated with a fictional vaccine that reduced this probability of hospitalisation after infection. We then used ChatGPT to help us decide how to handle the simulated data in order to determine vaccine effectiveness and draft a related research paper. AI-based language models in data analysis and scientific writing are an area of growing interest, and this exemplar analysis aims to contribute to the understanding of how ChatGPT can be used to facilitate these tasks.

We used the SWOT analysis framework to outline ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses and to discuss its opportunities for and threats to education. The strengths include using a sophisticated natural language model to generate plausible answers, self-improving capability, and providing personalised and real-time responses. As such, ChatGPT can increase access to information, facilitate personalised and complex learning, and decrease teaching workload, thereby making key processes and tasks more efficient. The weaknesses are a lack of deep understanding, difficulty in evaluating the quality of responses, a risk of bias and discrimination, and a lack of higher-order thinking skills. Threats to education include a lack of understanding of the context, threatening academic integrity, perpetuating discrimination in education, democratising plagiarism, and declining high-order cognitive skills. We provide agenda for educational practice and research in times of ChatGPT. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; educational technologies;

ChatGPT is an AI tool that offers a range of benefits, including increased student engagement, collaboration, and accessibility. However, is also raises concerns regarding academic honesty and plagiarism. This paper examines the opportunities and challenges of using ChatGPT in higher education, and discusses the potential risks and rewards of these tools. The paper also considers the difficulties of detecting and preventing academic dishonesty, and suggests strategies that universities can adopt to ensure ethical and responsible use of these tools. These strategies include developing policies and procedures, providing training and support, and using various methods to detect and prevent cheating. The paper concludes that while the use of AI in higher education presents both opportunities and challenges, universities can effectively address these concerns by taking a proactive and ethical approach to the use of these tools. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","detection and prevention; higher education; Machine-generated writing; plagiarism","","","","","Ahsan K., Akbar S., Kam B., Contract cheating in higher education: A systematic literature review and future research agenda, Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education, 47, 4, pp. 523-539, (2022); Barber M., Bird L., Fleming J., Titterington-Giles E., Edwards E., Leyland C., Gravity assist: Propelling higher education towards a brighter future, (2021); Bommasani R., Hudson D.A., Adeli E., Altman R., Arora S., von Arx S., Bernstein M.S., Bohg J., Bosselut A., Brunskill E., Brynjolfsson E., Buch S., Card D., Castellon R., Chatterji N., Chen A., Creel K., Davis J.Q., Demszky D., Liang P., On the opportunities and risks of foundation models, (2021); Brown T.B., Mann B., Ryder N., Subbiah M., Kaplan J., Dhariwal P., Neelakantan A., Shyam P., Sastry G., Askell A., Agarwal S., Herbert-Voss A., Krueger G., Henighan T., Child R., Ramesh A., Ziegler D.M., Wu J., Winter C., Amodei D., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33, pp. 1877-1901, (2020); Dawson P., Sutherland-Smith W., Can markers detect contract cheating?

Therefore, most workshops and seminars held by the KCSE were operated online. The training programs designed were all executed without any difficulties. There were four workshops in 2020, 11 in 2021, and nine in 2022. The editors and staff of the KCSE’s member institutes participated in these events more actively than before the COVID-19 pandemic, and the number of participants increased. Even before the pandemic, scholarly journal publishing had already been digitalized and implemented online through manuscript management systems (e-submission systems); therefore, the pandemic did not cause operational problems. The number of submissions during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic soared, especially in the medical field [1] and on the topic of COVID-19 itself. Many scientific articles have helped medical professionals care for persons infected with COVID-19. Therefore, scientific journals received a very high level of recognition as a valuable resource for society as a whole during this critical pandemic. I am delighted to see that scientific, technological, and medical journals in Korea have played a pivotal role in combating COVID-19, and I am proud to have served as the president of the organization of those journal editors for 3 years. I applaud our members for their devotion to journal publishing as editor-publishers [2].

Two chemistry-focused modules in year 1 and year 2 of a pharmaceutical science program are used to study and evaluate ChatGPT-generated responses in relation to the end-of-year exam assessments. For questions that focused on knowledge and understanding with “describe” and “discuss” verbs, the ChatGPT generated responses. For questions that focused on application of knowledge and interpretation with nontext information, the ChatGPT technology reached a limitation. A further analysis of the quality of responses is reported in this study. ChatGPT is not considered a high-risk technology tool in relation to cheating. Similar to the COVID-19 disruption, ChatGPT is expected to provide a catalyst for educational discussions on academic integrity and assessment design. © 2023 The Authors.

Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT on questions within the scope of the United States Medical Licensing Examination Step 1 and Step 2 exams, as well as to analyze responses for user interpretability. Methods: We used 2 sets of multiple-choice questions to evaluate ChatGPT’s performance, each with questions pertaining to Step 1 and Step 2. The first set was derived from AMBOSS, a commonly used question bank for medical students, which also provides statistics on question difficulty and the performance on an exam relative to the user base. The second set was the National Board of Medical Examiners (NBME) free 120 questions. ChatGPT’s performance was compared to 2 other large language models, GPT-3 and InstructGPT. The text output of each ChatGPT response was evaluated across 3 qualitative metrics: logical justification of the answer selected, presence of information internal to the question, and presence of information external to the question. Results: Of the 4 data sets, AMBOSS-Step1, AMBOSS-Step2, NBME-Free-Step1, and NBME-Free-Step2, ChatGPT achieved accuracies of 44% (44/100), 42% (42/100), 64.4% (56/87), and 57.8% (59/102), respectively. ChatGPT outperformed InstructGPT by 8.15% on average across all data sets, and GPT-3 performed similarly to random chance. The model demonstrated a significant decrease in performance as question difficulty increased (P=.01) within the AMBOSS-Step1 data set. We found that logical justification for ChatGPT’s answer selection was present in 100% of outputs of the NBME data sets. Internal information to the question was present in 96.8% (183/189) of all questions. The presence of information external to the question was 44.5% and 27% lower for incorrect answers relative to correct answers on the NBME-Free-Step1 (P<.001) and NBME-Free-Step2 (P=.001) data sets, respectively. Conclusions: ChatGPT marks a significant improvement in natural language processing models on the tasks of medical question answering. By performing at a greater than 60% threshold on the NBME-Free-Step-1 data set, we show that the model achieves the equivalent of a passing score for a third-year medical student. Additionally, we highlight ChatGPT’s capacity to provide logic and informational context across the majority of answers. These facts taken together make a compelling case for the potential applications of ChatGPT as an interactive medical education tool to support learning. ©Aidan Gilson, Conrad W Safranek, Thomas Huang, Vimig Socrates, Ling Chi, Richard Andrew Taylor, David Chartash.","","artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; conversational agent; education technology; generative pre-trained transformer; GPT; machine learning; medical education; MedQA; natural language processing; NLP","","","National Institutes of Health, NIH, (T35DK104689); National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK; Yale School of Medicine, YSM","This publication was made possible by the Yale School of Medicine Fellowship for Medical Student Research.

In this commentary, we discuss the potential impacts of GAI text-based systems for the chemistry community. The recent launch of ChatGPT, a free GAI text-based system by OpenAI, has sparked concerns regarding academic integrity and student assessment across all educational levels. However, the capabilities of these systems will impact more than the teaching and learning of chemistry; GAI systems can serve students, faculty, and administrators for teaching and learning, research, and professional activities. Herein we explore various ways students and faculty might use GAI systems, identify potential benefits and risks, and consider equity and accessibility issues. We hope to inspire productive discussions on leveraging GAI technology’s capabilities while recognizing its limitations. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.","","Communication/Writing; Curriculum; First-Year Undergraduate/General; General Public; Graduate Education/Research; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Professional Development; Second-Year Undergraduate; Upper-Division Undergraduate","","","","","EDITORIAL: OpenAI’s ChatGPT raises concerns over academic integrity, authenticity, The Daily Targum, (2022); Bowman E., A new AI chatbot might do your homework for you.

Data released in 2022 revealed severe disparities in pass rates based on race, age, and language, exacerbating these concerns. In this paper, we explore the potential of generative artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT to address core problems of the ASWB exams, including the use of a multiple-choice format that does not reflect real-world social work practice. To assess its social work reasoning, we used ChatGPT to answer ASWB-developed practice questions for the Bachelors, Masters, and Clinical exams. ChatGPT scored 76%, 80%, and 64%, respectively, and identified additional validity challenges. Based on this performance, we provide a proof-of-concept for how generative AI might move us toward a more valid and equitable exam. While we strongly support licensure requirements, state regulators and legislators should temporarily suspend the use of the ASWB exams for this purpose. © The Author(s) 2023.","article; artificial intelligence; human; human experiment; licensing; proof of concept; reasoning; social work practice; validity","dynamic testing; generative artificial intelligence; licensing; social work professionals; validity","","","","","Albright D.L., Thyer B.A., A test of the validity of the LCSW examination: Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?, Social Work Research, 34, 4, pp. 229-234, (2010); Apgar D., Nienow M., Newly released data on examination pass rates supports need for widespread reform, Research on Social Work Practice, 33, 1, pp. 5-7, (2023); Asakura K., Occhiuto K., Todd S., Leithead C., Clapperton R., A call to action on artificial intelligence and social work education: Lessons learned from a simulation project using natural language processing, Journal of Teaching in Social Work, 40, 5, pp. 501-518, (2020); Bonanno G.A., Wortman C.B., Lehman D.R., Tweed R.G., Haring M., Sonnega J., Carr D., Nesse R.M., Resilience to loss and chronic grief: A prospective study from preloss to 18-months postloss, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 83, 5, pp. 1150-1164, (2002); DeCarlo M.P., Racial bias and ASWB exams: A failure of data equity, Research on Social Work Practice, 32, 3, pp. 255-258, (2022); Frey W.R., Patton D.U., Gaskell M.B., McGregor K.A., Artificial intelligence and inclusion: Formerly gang-involved youth as domain experts for analyzing unstructured twitter data, Social Science Computer Review, 38, 1, pp. 42-56, (2020); Hammer A.; Hu K.; Kelly S.M., ChatGPT passes exams from law and business schools; Kubler-Ross E., On death and dying, (1969); Kubler-Ross E., Kessler D., On grief and grieving: Finding the meaning of grief through the five stages of loss, (2005); McVean A., It’s time to let the Five Stages of Grief die; National Association of Social Workers A., NASW opposes Association of Social Work Boards (ASWB) exams; Nienow M., Sogabe E., Husain A., Racial disparity in social work licensure exam pass rates, Research on Social Work Practice, 33, 1, pp. 76-83, (2023); Perron B.E., Victor B.G., Bushman G., Moore A., Ryan J.P., Lu A.J., Piellusch E.K., Detecting substance-related problems in narrative investigation summaries of child abuse and neglect using text mining and machine learning, Child Abuse & Neglect, 98, (2019); Smith M.J., Parham B., Mitchell J., Blajeski S., Harrington M., Ross B., Johnson J., Brydon D.M., Johnson J.E., Cuddeback G.S., Smith J.D., Bell M.D., Mcgeorge R., Kaminski K., Suganuma A., Kubiak S., Virtual reality job interview training for adults receiving prison-based employment services: A randomized controlled feasibility and initial effectiveness trial, Criminal Justice and Behavior, 50, 2, pp. 272-293, (2023); Stroebe M., Schut H., Boerner K., Cautioning health-care professionals: Bereaved persons are misguided through the stages of grief, OMEGA—Journal of Death and Dying, 74, 4, pp. 455-473, (2017); Thyer B.A., LCSW Examination pass rates: Implications for social work education, Clinical Social Work Journal, 39, pp. 296-300, (2011); Victor B.G., Perron B.E., Sokol R.L., Fedina L., Ryan J.P., Automated identification of domestic violence in written child welfare records: Leveraging text mining and machine learning to enhance social work research and evaluation, Journal of the Society for Social Work and Research, 12, 4, pp. 631-655, (2021)","","","","","","","","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152059357"

This project aimed to examine novel ways to teach data-intensive disciplines in public health, environmental health, and nutrition using the approach called SOLSTICE (an abbreviation of solution-oriented, student-led, computationally enriched). As part of the approach, I expanded the utility of a mistake-find exercise. Together with teaching assistants we have created a system where detected mistakes could signify something about students’ knowledge, skills, and attitudes, such as attention to detail and stylistic preferences. The system also helped us to explore students’ familiarity with scientific methods, subject-specific terms, and concepts. We classified implanted errors according to level comprehension and critical thinking – from light to deep, from simple ‘typos’ and incomplete information to logical inconsistencies and contradictory statements. Some exercises called for students to sort through common confusions in using statistical tests. Some exercises focused on omissions in describing study designs.

Since the advent of tools based on recent advancement in artificial intelligence (AI), educators have made major strides in applying state-of-the-art technologies to writing classrooms. In November 2022, an AI-powered chatbot named ChatGPT capable of automatic text generation was introduced to the public. The study tried to apply ChatGPT’s text generation feature in a one-week L2 writing practicum. The study adopted a qualitative approach to investigate students’ behaviors and reflections in their exposure to ChatGPT in writing classrooms. The developmental features in learning activities and reflective perceptions were triangulated for the piloting evaluation of the impact of ChatGPT on L2 writing learners. The findings revealed the affordance and potential applicability of the tool in L2 writing pedagogy. Additionally, the tool also showcased an automatic workflow that could maximize the efficiency in composing writing. However, participants generally expressed their concern with its threats to academic honesty and educational equity. The study impelled the reconceptualization of plagiarism in the new era, development of regulatory policies and pedagogical guidance to regulate proper utilization of the tool. Being a pioneering effort, the study accentuated future research directions for more insights into the application of ChatGPT in L2 learning, and the establishment of corresponding pedagogical adjustments. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","","AI-enhanced education; Automatic text generation; ChatGPT; Plagiarism; Technology-enhanced writing","","","","","Adams D., Chuah K.-M., Artificial Intelligence-Based Tools in Research Writing, Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: A Practical Approach, pp. 169-184, (2022); Alshater, M, Exploring the Role of Artificial Intelligence in Enhancing Academic Performance: A Case Study of ChatGPT, SSRN Scholarly Paper, (2022); Aydin O., Karaarslan E., OpenAI ChatGPT Generated Literature Review: Digital Twin in Healthcare, SSRN Scholarly Paper, (2022); Discursive Competence in Chatgpt, Part 1: Talking with Dragons Version 2., (2023); Bikowski D., Vithanage R., Effects of web-based collaborative writing on individual L2 writing development, Language Learning & Technology, 20, 1, pp. 79-99, (2016); GPT Takes the Bar Exam, (2022); Bowen G.A., Document analysis as a qualitative research method, Qualitative Research Journal, 9, 2, pp. 27-40, (2009); Bowen N.E.J.A., Nanni A., Piracy, playing the system, or poor policies?

Improved performance in natural language processing tasks, such as text and speech processing, have fueled impressive demonstrations of these models’ capabilities. Perhaps no demonstration has been more impactful to date than the introduction of the publicly available online chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI, which is based on a natural language processing model known as a Generative Pretrained Transformer. Through a series of questions posed by the authors about obstetrics and gynecology to ChatGPT as prompts, we evaluated the model's ability to handle clinical-related queries. Its answers demonstrated that in its current form, ChatGPT can be valuable for users who want preliminary information about virtually any topic in the field. Because its educational role is still being defined, we must recognize its limitations. Although answers were generally eloquent, informed, and lacked a significant degree of mistakes or misinformation, we also observed evidence of its weaknesses. A significant drawback is that the data on which the model has been trained are apparently not readily updated. The specific model that was assessed here, seems to not reliably (if at all) source data from after 2021. Users of ChatGPT who expect data to be more up to date need to be aware of this drawback. An inability to cite sources or to truly understand what the user is asking suggests that it has the capability to mislead. Responsible use of models like ChatGPT will be important for ensuring that they work to help but not harm users seeking information on obstetrics and gynecology. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","","artificial intelligence; cesarean delivery; chatbots; ChatGPT; ethics; gynecology; home birth; informed consent; maternal-fetal medicine; obstetrics; oncology; preeclampsia; prematurity; preterm birth; progesterone; reproductive medicine; short cervix; vaginal progesterone","","","","","Russell S.J., Norvig P., Artificial intelligence: a modern approach, (2021); A.I. is mastering language should we trust what it says?; Optimizing language models for dialogue; Tingiris S., Exploring GPT-3: an unofficial first look at the general-purpose language processing API from OpenAI, Packt Publishing, (2021); Biswas S., ChatGPT and the Future of Medical Writing, Radiology, (2023); Sarraju A., Bruemmer D., Van Iterson E., Cho L., Rodriguez F., Laffin L., Appropriateness of cardiovascular disease prevention recommendations obtained from a popular online chat-based artificial intelligence model, JAMA, 329, pp. 842-844, (2023); Shen Y., Heacock L., Elias J., Et al.; Flanagin A., Bibbins-Domingo K., Berkwits M., Christiansen S.L., Nonhuman “Authors” and implications for the integrity of scientific publication and medical knowledge, JAMA, 329, pp. 637-639, (2023); Bronstein J.M., Wingate M.S., Brisendine A.E., Why is the U.S. preterm birth rate so much higher than the rates in Canada, Great Britain, and Western Europe?, Int J Health Serv, 48, pp. 622-640, (2018); Premature birth; Liu Y.H., Zhang Y.S., Chen J.Y., Et al.; Richards E.M.F., Giorgione V., Stevens O., Thilaganathan B.; Prematurity profile.

In January 2023, ChatGPT reached over 100 million users, making it the fastest-growing consumer application to date. This interview with ChatGPT is part 2 of a larger interview with ChatGPT. It provides a snapshot of the current capabilities of ChatGPT and illustrates the vast potential for medical education, research, and practice but also hints at current problems and limitations. In this conversation with Gunther Eysenbach, the founder and publisher of JMIR Publications, ChatGPT generated some ideas on how to use chatbots in medical education. It also illustrated its capabilities to generate a virtual patient simulation and quizzes for medical students; critiqued a simulated doctor-patient communication and attempts to summarize a research article (which turned out to be fabricated); commented on methods to detect machine-generated text to ensure academic integrity; generated a curriculum for health professionals to learn about artificial intelligence (AI); and helped to draft a call for papers for a new theme issue to be launched in JMIR Medical Education on ChatGPT. The conversation also highlighted the importance of proper “prompting.” Although the language generator does make occasional mistakes, it admits these when challenged. The well-known disturbing tendency of large language models to hallucinate became evident when ChatGPT fabricated references. The interview provides a glimpse into the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT and the future of AI-supported medical education. Due to the impact of this new technology on medical education, JMIR Medical Education is launching a call for papers for a new e-collection and theme issue. The initial draft of the call for papers was entirely machine generated by ChatGPT, but will be edited by the human guest editors of the theme issue. ©Gunther Eysenbach.","","AI; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; future of education; generative language model; interview; medical education","","","","","Chatbots and conversational agents; ChatGPT statistics 2023: trends and the future perspectives; Gilson A, Safranek CW, Huang T, Socrates V, Chi L, Taylor RA, Et al., How does ChatGPT perform on the United States Medical Licensing Examination?

Without such tools, the well-intentioned policies are likely to remain on paper. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","ChatGPT; editorial policies; AI-generated papers; challenges","","","","","Goggin B., Tolentino D., ChatGPT Can Help You Fool OpenAI’s Anti-Cheating Tool, NBC News, (2023); Hosseini M., Rasmussen L.M., Resnik D.B., Using AI to Write Scholarly Publications, Accountability in Research, pp. 1-9, (2023); Editorial, Nature, 613, 7945, (2023); Pividori M., Greene C.S., A Publishing Infrastructure for AI-Assisted Academic Authoring, bioRxiv, (2023); Thorp H.H., ChatGPT is Fun, but Not an Author, Science, 379, 6630, (2023); Turnitin Announces AI Writing Detector and AI Writing Resource Center for Educators, (2023); Wiggers K., Most Sites Claiming to Catch AI-Written Text Fail Spectacularly, TechCrunch, (2023); Xu S., Hu G., A Cross-Disciplinary and Severity-Based Study of Author-Related Reasons for Retraction, Accountability in Research, 29, 8, pp. 512-536, (2022); Zielinski C., Winker M., Aggarwal R., Ferris L., Heinemann M., Florencio Lapena J., Pai S., Ing E., Citrome L., Chatbots, ChatGPT, and Scholarly Manuscripts: WAME Recommendations on ChatGPT and Chatbots in Relation to Scholarly Publications, (2023)","","","","","","","","Letter","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149286861"

Design/methodology/approach: Literature were sourced from Google scholar and Scopus database-indexed journals to assess the potentials and drawbacks of using ChatGPT (generative pretrained transformer). Findings: The study found that ChatGPT can aid with technical and reader services such as answering basic reference inquiries, navigating the library website and assisting with research, cataloguing, classification and collection development. However, due to the risk of inaccurate query responses, misuse, limited comprehension, input limitation and technological reliance, it should be a complementary technology rather than a replacement for human librarians.

These technologies and digital tools have been explored in terms of their affordances and their limitations during implementation in teaching practices. Teachers have actively worked to balance how a technology serves as a vehicle for learning against the challenges that are introduced through its implementation. In recent years, due to our increased reliance on digital tools and online learning environments, our education communities have first railed against, and then rallied for, each appearance of a new website, tool or platform. Whilst initial reactions can be negative (such as that recently observed on the appearance of the artificial intelligence (AI) based chatbot tool ChatGPT), many teachers will progress towards adoption of technologies in their practices once the affordances have been teased out. In some ways, as an analogy, teaching practice could be considered as an equilibrium reaction responding to the pressures of change. In this Editorial, I recognise that teachers are adaptive and creative therefore research that evidences authentic practice using AI to support student learning will increase. In parallel, as a journal, we are facing new challenges relating to the role of AI in authorship and peer review, most publishers are grappling with establishing their position on any authorship that involves AI generated text. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Review","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151869094"

To assess the update capabilities of ChatGPT, we conducted tests involving both basic and technically relevant questions. Our preliminary testing revealed that ChatGPT&#x0027;s information can be updated and corrected at one time, but it may take some time for the changes to be reflected in ChatGPT&#x0027;s responses, so it may not always possess the latest knowledge regarding specific topics. We further discuss the prospective influence of ChatGPT on the field of intelligent vehicles, particularly possible applications of ChatGPT in areas like autonomous driving, human-vehicle interaction, and intelligent transportation systems, highlighting challenges and opportunities associated with these applications. Additionally, we address technical questions, such as the feasibility of training intelligent vehicles using the same methods as ChatGPT and the reflection of the intelligence of intelligent vehicles in the context of human-machine shared control. In conclusion, this letter presents a preliminary exploration of the potential of ChatGPT for intelligent vehicle research, from an IEEE TIV perspective, acknowledging the limitations and uncertainties of this emerging technology.

The use of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based models has the potential to revolutionize the field of radiology, offering new possibilities for improving accuracy, efficiency, and patient outcome. Current applications of GPT-based models in radiology include report generation, educational support, clinical decision support, patient communication, and data analysis. As these models continue to advance and improve, it is likely that more innovative uses for GPT-based models in the field of radiology at large will be developed, further enhancing the role of technology in the diagnostic process. ChatGPT is a variant of GPT that is specifically fine-tuned for conversational language understanding and generation. This article reports some answers provided by ChatGPT to various questions that radiologists may have regarding ChatGPT and identifies the potential benefits ChatGPT may offer in their daily practice but also current limitations.

Does the adoption of information technology lead to massive regional unemployment? It is a crucial and unresolved issue for the government, enterprise employees, and researchers. Combining the 2005–2020 panel and the smart city (SC) construction policy in China, this article employs the difference in differences (DID) method to study the impact of informatization construction on labour spatial allocation. We found that informatization construction significantly attracted labour and improved labour spatial allocation. After the SC construction policy’s implementation, compared with non-SCs, the average increase of SC pilots in the labour force is about 0.78 million people. Besides, stimulating economic growth, improving the environment, and enhancing public services are the mechanisms of the SC construction policy on labour spatial allocation. Furthermore, this policy effect has heterogeneous industry department and category characteristics. The Tertiary and secondary industry department receives a more significant impact. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","","DID model; informatization; labour spatial allocation; Smart city","","","","","Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., The Race Between Man and Machine: Implications of Technology for Growth, Factor Shares, and Employment, The American Economic Review, 108, 6, pp. 1488-1542, (2018); Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and Work, The Economics of Artificial Intelligence: An Agenda, pp. 197-236, (2019); Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., Robots and Jobs: Evidence from US Labor Markets, The Journal of Political Economy, 128, 6, pp. 2188-2244, (2020); Acemoglu D., Restrepo P., The Wrong Kind of AI?

Rapid shifts to synchronous and asynchronous online delivery modes reshaped classrooms built upon frequent peer review and student collaboration in writing, forcing students and faculty into educational technologies that raised issues of privacy, equity, and surveillance. Yet, digital writing faculty responded to these challenges in ways that prioritised individual autonomy of student writers with creative assessments, improved access to texts, thoughtful connections to employers and audiences beyond the academy, and enhanced classroom collaborations via digital technologies. As this Editorial explores, the story of digital writing pedagogy during the pandemic became the story of a constant push and pull with the technologies that created digital writing itself. And just as teachers of digital writing began to emerge from the disruptions of the pandemic, a new wave of digital writing technologies enter the mix: AI-powered writing generators have arrived via applications such as ChatGPT with the seeming potential to shape the role of digital literacy once again. As this Editorial argues, the technologies of digital writing can be harnessed to reflect the values of education – openness, individual autonomy, and the power of knowledge – but only when the practitioners of digital writing pedagogy understand and access digital writing tools. At this time, those tools are again in rapid flux and the digital writing landscape remains profoundly unsettled. Practitioner Notes 1. The shift to online teaching during the pandemic affected the teaching of digital writing, leading to better practices for integrating synchronous learning technologies (e.g., Zoom). 2. Practitioners should be alert to equity and access issues and deliberate in engaging digital teaching platforms, evaluating how they affect collaboration, peer interaction, and student autonomy. 3. Practitioners should consider specifically whether teaching and assessment tools have a history of decentring and dehumanizing students. 4. The principles of promoting collaboration and peer review in digital writing classrooms should be retained in a post-pandemic classroom. 5. Emerging from the pandemic, the teaching of digital writing faces potentially profound literacy changes from the emergence of artificial intelligence writing generators. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

Overview: ChatGPT, a LLM trained on massive amounts of textual data, is adept at fulfilling various language-related tasks. Despite its impressive capabilities, ChatGPT has serious limitations, such as occasionally giving incorrect answers, producing nonsensical content, and presenting misinformation as fact. Dental practitioners, assistants, and hygienists are not likely to be significantly impacted by LLMs. However, LLMs could affect the work of administrative personnel and the provision of dental telemedicine. LLMs offer potential for clinical decision support, text summarization, efficient writing, and multilingual communication. As more people seek health information from LLMs, it is crucial to safeguard against inaccurate, outdated, and biased responses to health-related queries. LLMs pose challenges for patient data confidentiality and cybersecurity that must be tackled. In dental education, LLMs present fewer challenges than in other academic fields. LLMs can enhance academic writing fluency, but acceptable usage boundaries in science need to be established. Conclusions: While LLMs such as ChatGPT may have various useful applications in dental medicine, they come with risks of malicious use and serious limitations, including the potential for misinformation. Clinical Significance: Along with the potential benefits of using LLMs as an additional tool in dental medicine, it is crucial to carefully consider the limitations and potential risks inherent in such artificial intelligence technologies. © 2023 The Authors.

In response, Nature and Science expressed their position that this chatbot cannot be listed as an author in the papers they publish.

As of now, ChatGPT can write pretty convincing student-level prose, but it is still not very good at answering quantitatively rich questions. Therefore, for the time being, the preceding concerns may not be shared by a large portion of the numeracy education community. However, as Google and WolframAlpha are definitely capable of answering standard and some non-standard quantitative queries, a future generation of artificial intelligence including both types of capabilities is not out of the question. So, the issue is still relevant to the readers of this journal. As we continue to focus on the higher-level skills and habits of mind that make up quantitative literacy (QL) and quantitative reasoning (QR), we should not forget that basic literacy and numeracy are still foundational building blocks. While AI is making advances in these basic realms, our human students seem to be losing ground, as implied by the most recent NAEP scores. Here we encourage our readership to focus on what makes QL/QR so challenging to teach, to human as well as artificial intelligences. © 2023, National Numeracy Network.

This paper aims to outline the applications, benefits and risks of ChatGPT and large language models in general on tourism. It also aims to establish a research agenda for investigating the implications of these models in tourism. Design/methodology/approach: Drawing on the available literature on ChatGPT, large language models and artificial intelligence, the paper identifies areas of application of ChatGPT for several tourism stakeholders. Potential benefits and risks are then considered. Findings: ChatGPT and other similar models are likely to have a profound impact on several tourism processes. They will contribute to further streamline customer service in front-of-house operations and increase productivity and efficiency in back-of-house operations. Although negative consequences for human resources are expected, this technology mostly enhances tourism employees. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is one of the first studies that explore the potential implications of ChatGPT in tourism and hospitality. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","AI in tourism; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Generative language models; Intelligent automation; LLMs; Tourism","","","","","Ali F., OpenAI C., Let the devil speak for itself: should ChatGPT be allowed or banned in hospitality and tourism schools?, Journal of Global Hospitality and Tourism, 2, 1, pp. 1-6, (2023); Bornet P., Barkin I., Wirtz J., Intelligent Automation: Welcome to the World of Hyperautomation, (2021); Buhalis D., Technology in tourism-from information communication technologies to eTourism and smart tourism towards ambient intelligence tourism: a perspective article, Tourism Review, 75, 1, pp. 267-272, (2020); Buhalis D., Moldavska I., Voice assistants in hospitality: using artificial intelligence for customer service, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology, 13, 3, pp. 386-403, (2022); Cai D., Li H., Law R., Anthropomorphism and OTA chatbot adoption: a mixed methods study, Journal of Travel and Tourism Marketing, 39, 2, pp. 228-255, (2022); Chui M., Roberts R., Yee L., Generative AI is here: how tools like ChatGPT could change your business, (2022); Cobbe J., Singh J., Artificial intelligence as a service: legal responsibilities, liabilities, and policy challenges, Computer Law and Security Review, 42, (2021); Delouya S., I asked ChatGPT to do my work and write an insider article for me.

Just as any technological advance opens discussions about ethics, so the implications of AI for HPE ethics need to be identified, anticipated, and accommodated so that HPE can utilise AI without compromising crucial ethical principles. Rather than focussing on AI technology, this Guide focuses on the ethical issues likely to face HPE teachers and administrators as they encounter and use AI systems in their teaching environment. While many of the ethical principles may be familiar to readers in other contexts, they will be viewed in light of AI, and some unfamiliar issues will be introduced. They include data gathering, anonymity, privacy, consent, data ownership, security, bias, transparency, responsibility, autonomy, and beneficence. In the Guide, each topic explains the concept and its importance and gives some indication of how to cope with its complexities. Ideas are drawn from personal experience and the relevant literature. In most topics, further reading is suggested so that readers may further explore the concepts at their leisure. The aim is for HPE teachers and decision-makers at all levels to be alert to these issues and to take proactive action to be prepared to deal with the ethical problems and opportunities that AI usage presents to HPE. © 2023 The Author(s).

Existing literature offers a wealth of research on design, deploying and evaluating AI-driven systems in education. However, the challenges related to the growing influence of AI in the society, calls for revisiting research foundations of AI in education in order to inform decision-making in policy and guide future research. This special issue of Computers & Education: Artificial Intelligence brings 11 papers that explore the theme of empowering learners for the age of AI. The contributions of these papers can be broadly grouped into seven main themes: intersection between AI and humans that looks at the space of coordination; assessment that explores challenges and opportunities afforded by the use of AI in educational assessment; explainability in AI as a critical need for humans in education to understand and trust AI; design for learning that offers principles for designing AI-driven systems and educational opportunities; conceptual AI and learning exploring the need for the development of new theories of learning and their connections with existing theoretical foundations in education; accurate predictions and their role in future education; and applications of AI in classrooms and educational systems. The findings of these studies highlight pressing research and policies challenges and opportunities that arise with the broad penetration of AI in education. They also emphasize the need for future research that addresses issues of ethics, bias and farness in the use of AI in education; challenges associated with data sources and ownership as the key fuel and enabler of present-day AI generation; AI literacies and competencies of stakeholders who use and are impacted by AI in education; identification of effective learning and teaching practices with the use of AI; and policy development to increase responsiveness of education systems to rapid changes driven by AI. © 2023","","","","","CELLA; Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom, (ES/S015701/1); XAI-ED; Economic and Social Research Council, ESRC; Australian Research Council, ARC, (DP210100060, DP220101209); Jacobs Foundation","Funding text 1: This special issue was in part supported by funding from Australian Research Council ( DP210100060 , DP220101209 ), Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom ( ES/S015701/1 ), and Jacobs Foundation (CELLA 2 CERES) awarded to the first author. Any opinions, findings, conclusions, or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Australian Research Council, Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom, or Jacobs Foundation.; Funding text 2: The first and most prominent theme centres on what we describe as “the space of coordination” - the intersection between AI and humans. What is being coordinated in this space? Currently, almost everything related to learning is under examination. Molenar (2022) focuses on tasks that can be “offloaded from humans to AI” (p. 1) and then “onloaded from AI to humans” (p.1), focusing specifically on a hybrid systems to help develop self regulated learning skills in young learners. She offers a hybrid model of regulation, emphasizing four regulation degrees: AI, co-regulation, shared-regulation, and self-regulation with an intent to support SRL developing through interaction with AI. Markauskaite et al. (2022) explore this middle space by engaging a number of experts in the learning analytics and AI fields to articulate some direction of an “interconnected, fast changing world” where “agentic machines” (p. 1) are the norm. Their Table 1 captures the range of perspectives regarding what capabilities are needed, how we develop those capabilities in humans, and how we study the development of those capabilities. Siemens et al. (2022) suggest that intelligence is too broad a term to provide utility when assessing which specific tasks or activities should be conducted by human or machine. Instead, they argue that cognition and discrete cognitive activities should be the foundation for evaluating and assessing how people learn, sensemake, and make decisions when agents with cognitive capacity are present.The third major theme of this issue relates to explainability of AI. Explainability refers to the ability of humans to understand and trust AI. This need will increase in importance, especially as the intersections between human and AI require greater collaboration and coordination (see Carvalho et al., 2022; Markauskaite et al., 2022; Molenar, 2022; Siemens et al., 2022). Khosravi et al. (2022) introduce the XAI-ED, detailing how existing explainable AI approaches can be applied to the education sector. XAI-ED incorporates insight from numerous fields, including cognitive and learning sciences, AI, human computer interaction, and learning analytics in order to present a “means for educational tool developers and researchers” (p. 4) with the means to support the “creation of trustworthy, AI-augmented, sociotechnical systems” (p. 18). They then present four case studies that detail how XAI-ED is reflected in different AIED systems: learner sourced, open-ended learning environments, writing analytics, and team-based learning. They conclude by advocating for broader discussion around explainable AI in education, increased research and adoption of these models, and involvement of multiple stakeholders in developing tools and systems.This special issue was in part supported by funding from Australian Research Council (DP210100060, DP220101209), Economic and Social Research Council of the United Kingdom (ES/S015701/1), and Jacobs Foundation (CELLA 2 CERES) awarded to the first author.

The study explores three main areas: (1) How did ChatGPT answer questions related to science education? (2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts. ChatGPT was used as a research tool for assistance with editing and to experiment with making the research narrative clearer. The intention of the paper is to act as a catalyst for a broader conversation about the use of generative AI in science education. © 2023, The Author(s).","","ChatGPT; Digital technologies; Generative artificial intelligence and science education; Large language models","","","","","Not girly, not sexy, not glamorous’: Primary school girls’ and parents’ constructions of science aspirations1, Pedagogy, Culture & Society, 21, 1, pp. 171-194, (2013); Boudreau C., I asked ChatGPT about its carbon footprint and it didn’t have a real answer, Insider, (2023); Buchanan J., ChatGPT cites economics papers that do not exist, Economist Writing Every Day, (2023); Bybee R.W., Learning science and the science of learning: Science educators’ essay collection, NSTA Press., (2002); Celik I., Towards Intelligent-TPACK: An empirical study on teachers’ professional knowledge to ethically integrate artificial intelligence (AI)-based tools into education, Computers in Human Behavior, 138, (2023); Cope B., Kalantzis M., Searsmith D., Artificial intelligence for education: Knowledge and its assessment in AI-enabled learning ecologies, Educational Philosophy and Theory, 53, 12, pp. 1229-1245, (2021); Darics E., Poppel L., Debate: ChatGPT offers unseen opportunities to sharpen students’ critical skills, The Conversation., (2023); Du X., Wong B., Science career aspiration and science capital in China and UK: A comparative study using PISA data, International Journal of Science Education, pp. 1-20, (2019); Gleason N., Chatgpt and the Rise of AI Writers: How Should Higher Education Respond?

The Gcode generation process, which controls the movements of the printer's extruder and the layer-by-layer build process, is a crucial step in the AM process and optimizing the Gcode is essential for ensuring the quality of the final product and reducing print time and waste. ChatGPT can be trained on existing Gcode data to generate optimized Gcode for specific polymeric materials, printers, and objects, as well as analyze and optimize the Gcode based on various printing parameters such as printing temperature, printing speed, bed temperature, fan speed, wipe distance, extrusion multiplier, layer thickness, and material flow. Here the capability of ChatGPT in performing complex tasks related to AM process optimization was demonstrated. In particular performance tests were conducted to evaluate ChatGPT's expertise in technical matters, focusing on the evaluation of printing parameters and bed detachment, warping, and stringing issues for Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) methods using thermoplastic polyurethane polymer as feedstock material. This work provides effective feedback on the performance of ChatGPT and assesses its potential for use in the AM field.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for scholars. Practitioner Notes 1. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 has taken higher education by storm with threats of plagiarism and integrity as key concerns. 2. We argue that effective teacher leadership is needed to develop student character so they use ChatGPT for good, rather than for personal benefit. 3. ChatGPT can create new and innovative authentic assessment in higher education. 4. ChatGPT offers students the opportunity to simplify the learning process to create less distraction, and more flow. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

This study evaluated the accuracy of differential-diagnosis lists generated by ChatGPT-3 for clinical vignettes with common chief complaints. General internal medicine physicians created clinical cases, correct diagnoses, and five differential diagnoses for ten common chief complaints. The rate of correct diagnosis by ChatGPT-3 within the ten differential-diagnosis lists was 28/30 (93.3%). The rate of correct diagnosis by physicians was still superior to that by ChatGPT-3 within the five differential-diagnosis lists (98.3% vs. 83.3%, p = 0.03). The rate of correct diagnosis by physicians was also superior to that by ChatGPT-3 in the top diagnosis (53.3% vs. 93.3%, p < 0.001). The rate of consistent differential diagnoses among physicians within the ten differential-diagnosis lists generated by ChatGPT-3 was 62/88 (70.5%). In summary, this study demonstrates the high diagnostic accuracy of differential-diagnosis lists generated by ChatGPT-3 for clinical cases with common chief complaints.

The chatbot turned out to be very capable, but also capable of deception, and the news broke that several researchers had listed the chatbot (including its earlier version) as co-authors of their academic papers. In response, Nature and Science expressed their position that this chatbot cannot be listed as an author in the papers they publish. Since an AI chatbot is not a human being, in the current legal system, the text automatically generated by an AI chatbot cannot be a copyrighted work; thus, an AI chatbot cannot be an author of a copyrighted work. Current AI chatbots such as ChatGPT are much more advanced than search engines in that they produce original text, but they still remain at the level of a search engine in that they cannot take responsibility for their writing. For this reason, they also cannot be authors from the perspective of research ethics.","Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Publishing; Software; artificial intelligence; human; publishing; software","Artificial intelligence; Authorship; Chatbot; Copyright; Research ethics","","","","","","","","","","","","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149054141"

The aim was to provide an up-to-date overview of the upcoming changes and a brief analysis of the influential advancements in the use of AI in dental education since 2020. In addition, this review provides a guide for a dental curriculum update for undergraduate and postgraduate education in the context of advances in AI applications and their impact on dentistry. Unsurprisingly, most dental educators have limited knowledge and skills to assess AI applications, as they were not trained to do so. Also, AI technology has evolved exponentially in recent years. Factual reliability and opportunities with OpenAI Inc.’s ChatGPT are considered critical inflection points in the era of generative AI. Updating curricula at dental institutions is inevitable as advanced deep-learning approaches take over the clinical areas of dentistry and reshape diagnostics, treatment planning, management, and telemedicine screening. With recent advances in AI language models, communication with patients will change, and the foundations of dental education, including essay, thesis, or scientific paper writing, will need to adapt.

While exascale computing will enable simulations of larger systems, the extreme multiscale nature of many problems requires new techniques. Deep learning techniques have disrupted several domains, such as computer vision, language (e.g., ChatGPT), and computational biology, leading to breakthrough advances. Similarly, the adaptation of these techniques for scientific computing has led to a new and rapidly advancing branch of High-Performance Computing (HPC), which we call neural-HPC (NeuHPC). Proof of concept studies in domains such as computational fluid dynamics and material science have demonstrated advantages in both efficiency and accuracy compared to conventional solvers. However, NeuHPC is yet to be embraced in plasma simulations. This is partly due to general lack of awareness of NeuHPC in the space physics community as well as the fact that most plasma physicists do not have training in artificial intelligence and cannot easily adapt these new techniques to their problems. As we explain below, there is a solution to this. We consider NeuHPC a critical paradigm for knowledge discovery in space sciences and urgently advocate for its adoption by both researchers as well as funding agencies. Here, we provide an overview of NeuHPC and specific ways that it can overcome existing computational challenges and propose a roadmap for future direction.

Here, we appraise the roles of theory-based approaches focusing on the experiment-dominated wet-biology research areas of microbial growth and survival, cell physiology, host–pathogen interactions, and competitive or symbiotic interactions. Additional examples relate to analyses of genome-sequence data, climate change and planetary health, habitability, and astrobiology. We assess the importance of thought at each step of the research process; the roles of natural philosophy, and inconsistencies in logic and language, as drivers of scientific progress; the value of thought experiments; the use and limitations of artificial intelligence technologies, including their potential for interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research; and other instances when theory is the most-direct and most-scientifically robust route to scientific novelty including the development of techniques for practical experimentation or fieldwork. We highlight the intrinsic need for human engagement in scientific innovation, an issue pertinent to the ongoing controversy over papers authored using/authored by artificial intelligence (such as the large language model/chatbot ChatGPT). Other issues discussed are the way in which aspects of language can bias thinking towards the spatial rather than the temporal (and how this biased thinking can lead to skewed scientific terminology); receptivity to research that is non-mainstream; and the importance of theory-based science in education and epistemology. Whereas we briefly highlight classic works (those by Oakes Ames, Francis H.C. Crick and James D. Watson, Charles R. Darwin, Albert Einstein, James E. Lovelock, Lynn Margulis, Gilbert Ryle, Erwin R.J.A. Schrödinger, Alan M. Turing, and others), the focus is on microbiology studies that are more-recent, discussing these in the context of the scientific process and the types of scientific novelty that they represent. These include several studies carried out during the 2020 to 2022 lockdowns of the COVID-19 pandemic when access to research laboratories was disallowed (or limited). We interviewed the authors of some of the featured microbiology-related papers and—although we ourselves are involved in laboratory experiments and practical fieldwork—also drew from our own research experiences showing that such studies can not only produce new scientific findings but can also transcend barriers between disciplines, act counter to scientific reductionism, integrate biological data across different timescales and levels of complexity, and circumvent constraints imposed by practical techniques. In relation to urgent research needs, we believe that climate change and other global challenges may require approaches beyond the experiment. © 2023 The Authors.

The examination results were analyzed in terms of ChatGPT's overall performance score, its correct answer rate by the items' knowledge level, and the acceptability of its explanations of the items. ChatGPT's performance was lower than that of the medical students, and ChatGPT's correct answer rate was not related to the items' knowledge level. However, there was a relationship between acceptable explanations and correct answers.

Design/methodology/approach: This paper includes an interview with ChatGPT on its potential impact on academia and libraries. The interview discusses the benefits of ChatGPT such as improving search and discovery, reference and information services; cataloging and metadata generation; and content creation, as well as the ethical considerations that need to be taken into account, such as privacy and bias. Findings: ChatGPT has considerable power to advance academia and librarianship in both anxiety-provoking and exciting new ways. However, it is important to consider how to use this technology responsibly and ethically, and to uncover how we, as professionals, can work alongside this technology to improve our work, rather than to abuse it or allow it to abuse us in the race to create new scholarly knowledge and educate future professionals. Originality/value: This paper discusses the history and technology of GPT, including its generative pretrained transformer model, its ability to perform a wide range of language-based tasks and how ChatGPT uses this technology to function as a sophisticated chatbot. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","","Academia; AI; ChatGPT; Generative pretrained transformer; GPT-3; Libraries","","","","","Bishop C.M., Neural networks and their applications, Review of Scientific Instruments, 65, (1994); Brockman G., Cheung V., Pettersson L., Schneider J., Schulman J., Tang J., Zaremba W., Openai gym, arXiv, (2016); Budzianowski P., Vulic I., Hello, it’s GPT-2–how can I help you?
