But, moxibustion therapy used in primary care institutions in China is far from the due role of this therapy played in medical practice. The authors believe that the heat-sensitive moxibustion (HSM) robot should be developed by integrating the manipulation of moxibustion therapy with modern artifical intelligence technology so that moxibustion therapy can be operated precisely and easily, deqi of moxibustion be effectively stimulated and the cost of its manual manipulation be reduced. Eventually, the technology of moxibustion therapy can be popularized in the primary care institutions to serve the health of the people. This paper introduces the creation of HSM technology, the research and development (R&D) of HSM robot, and its advantages, as well as the application prospects. It is anticipated that the R&D of HSM robot may speed up the development of moxibustion therapy worldwide.","Artificial intelligence; Heat-sensitive moxibustion; Moxibustion technique; Robot","China; heat; human; moxibustion; robotics; China; Hot Temperature; Humans; Moxibustion; Robotics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85149427546

Artificial intelligence can significantly improve the convenience and user experience, but it requires a lot of storage, bandwidth, and computing resources. Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) extends intelligence services to IoT devices through offloading approaches and joint processing, which solves the resource bottleneck. However, designing advanced collaboration technology to offload tasks to MEC servers is still challenging. Heuristic algorithms and deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approaches have been proposed to offload tasks and minimize application latency. However, heuristic algorithms heavily depend on accurate mathematical models for the MEC system, and DRL does not make fair use of the relationship between devices in the MEC graph. To solve this, we propose a task offloading mechanism based on graph neural network (GNN), which can directly learn on graph data with messages passing and aggregation. We propose a graph reinforcement learning-based offloading (GRLO) framework, which models MEC as an acyclic graph and the offloading policy by graph state migration. GRLO combines GNN with the actor-critic network and trains offloading decision makers without labels. To efficiently train the GRLO, we propose a method that quickly explores action space and approaches the optimal solution. The numerical results show that the GRLO has lower latency compared to baselines while having generalization ability to new environments and topologies. Moreover, we verified the effectiveness of GRLO on a prototype. © 2014 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT); computation offloading; graph neural network (GNN); multiaccess edge computing (MEC); wireless communication","computation offloading; Data fusion; Decision making; Deep learning; Digital storage; Heuristic algorithms; Internet of things; Job analysis; Quality control; Reinforcement learning; Artifical intelligence; Artifical intelligence of thing; Cloud-computing; Computation offloading; Edge computing; Graph neural networks; Multi-access edge computing; Multiaccess; Performances evaluation; Quality-of-service; Task analysis; Wireless communication.; Wireless communications; Quality of service",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sabella, D., (2019) Developing software for multi-access edge computing, 20. , Sophia Antipolis, France, ETSI, White Paper; Tran, T.X., Pompili, D., Joint task offloading and resource allocation for multi-server mobile-edge computing networks (2019) IEEE Trans.

The aorta was automatically segmented by convolutional neural network (CNN) on FDG PET-CT of aortitis and control patients. The FDG PET-CT dataset was split into training (43 aortitis:21 control), test (12 aortitis:5 control) and validation (24 aortitis:14 control) cohorts. Radiomic features (RF), including SUV metrics, were extracted from the segmented data and harmonized. Three radiomic fingerprints were constructed: A—RFs with high diagnostic utility removing highly correlated RFs; B used principal component analysis (PCA); C—Random Forest intrinsic feature selection. The diagnostic utility was evaluated with accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Several RFs and Fingerprints had high AUC values (AUC > 0.8), confirmed by balanced accuracy, across training, test and external validation datasets. Good diagnostic performance achieved across several multi-centre datasets suggests that a radiomic pipeline can be generalizable. These findings could be used to build an automated clinical decision tool to facilitate objective and standardized assessment regardless of observer experience. © 2023 by the authors.","aortitis; convolutional neural network; machine learning; positron emission tomography/computed tomography; radiomics","biological marker; C reactive protein; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; glucose; prednisolone; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; aged; aortitis; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; automated pipeline; automation; biopsy; blood sampling; clinical article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; convolutional neural network; correlation coefficient; decision tree; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; feature extraction; feature selection; female; fever; health care quality; human; image processing; image segmentation; inflammation; k nearest neighbor; logistic regression analysis; machine learning; male; multilayer perceptron; national health service; normal distribution; patient selection; perceptron; pipeline; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; process optimization; quality control; radiomics; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; relapse; reproducibility; standardized uptake value; stochastic model; support vector machine; training; validation study; vasculitis; aortitis; procedures; Aortitis; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; ROC Curve",,"C reactive protein, 9007-41-4; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18, 63503-12-8; glucose, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3, 8027-56-3; prednisolone, 50-24-8; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Radiopharmaceuticals","Biograph 6 and Biograph 6 True Point; Biograph 64 mCT; Discovery 690; Discovery 710; Discovery MI DR; Discovery ST and STE; Gemini TF64",,"EP/L014823/1; MR/ N011775/1; Wellcome Trust, WT: 211100/Z/18/Z; National Institute for Health and Care Research, NIHR; British Heart Foundation, BHF: FS/18/12/33270; Royal Society: IF170011; Innovate UK; NIHR Imperial Biomedical Research Centre, BRC; Leeds Biomedical Research Centre, Leeds BRC","This study was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Doctoral Training in Tissue Engineering and Regenerative Medicine; Innovation in Medical and Biological Engineering—Grant No. EP/L014823/1.

Due to the large amount of imaging data that is generated in oncological hybrid imaging, AI applications are desirable for lesion detection and characterization in primary staging, therapy monitoring, and recurrence detection. Given the rapid developments in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, the role of AI will have significant impact on the imaging workflow and will eventually improve clinical decision making and outcomes. Methods and Results The first part of this narrative review discusses current research with an introduction to artificial intelligence in oncological hybrid imaging and key concepts in data science. The second part reviews relevant examples with a focus on applications in oncology as well as discussion of challenges and current limitations. Conclusion AI applications have the potential to leverage the diagnostic data stream with high efficiency and depth to facilitate automated lesion detection, characterization, and therapy monitoring to ultimately improve quality and efficiency throughout the medical imaging workflow. The goal is to generate reproducible, structured, quantitative diagnostic data for evidence-based therapy guidance in oncology. However, significant challenges remain regarding application development, benchmarking, and clinical implementation. Key Points: Hybrid imaging generates a large amount of multimodality medical imaging data with high complexity and depth. Advanced tools are required to enable fast and cost-efficient processing along the whole radiology value chain. AI applications promise to facilitate the assessment of oncological disease in hybrid imaging with high quality and efficiency for lesion detection, characterization, and response assessment. The goal is to generate reproducible, structured, quantitative diagnostic data for evidence-based oncological therapy guidance. Selected applications in three oncological entities (lung, prostate, and neuroendocrine tumors) demonstrate how AI algorithms may impact imaging-based tasks in hybrid imaging and potentially guide clinical decision making. © 2022.

Logistics robots with environment perception capability have been used to improve warehousing efficiency in logistics systems. However, autonomous mobile robots face computationally intensive and real-time demanding tasks such as navigation, localization, and obstacle avoidance. In this article, we present EventTube, an edge computing based event-aware system that can efficiently discover events from the video data captured by RGB-Monoculars and collaborate with individual devices to make timely decisions. EventTube deploys a semantic context extraction pipeline on edge servers to aggregate video streams from mobile robots and feed a few keyframes, including the start and end of the specific events to the successive perception pods, accelerating logistics robots' response speed. The event-related model parameters are trained and updated online on a server. The video data collected at the warehouse site for our mobile robots show that EventTube significantly improves parcel delivery efficiency without affecting regular deliveries. © 2005-2012 IEEE.","3-D detection and localization; artificial intelligence (AI); computer vision in logistics; edge computing","Cleaning; Computer vision; Efficiency; Intelligent robots; Logistics; Media streaming; Mobile robots; Semantics; Video recording; Warehouses; 3d detection and localization; Artifical intelligence; Computer vision in logistic; Detection and localization; Edge computing; Individual devices; Location awareness; Logistics system; Streaming medium; Task analysis; Edge computing",,,,,"National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2020YFB1805203","This work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant 2020YFB1805203",,,,,,,,,,"Li, T., Huang, B., Li, C., Huang, M., Application of convolution neural network object detection algorithm in logistics warehouse (2019) J.

At a time when KOREA’s status has recently attracted global attention due to the so-called “Korean Wave,” research on “Taebong kingdom,” which can be called KOREA’s Original, is being re-examined. However, at a time when the long-standing division of the two Koreas makes it difficult to directly investigate the Taebong Kingdom on the DMZ, reproducing the Taebong Kingdom through the Metaverse is expected to be the only alternative to the site approach caused by the division. Although the artificial intelligence digital human being, who is both the advocate and the finisher of the Taebong Kingdom, has already died biologically under the environment of the metaverse space, the so-called “King Gungye” will be revived in digital form in the metaverse space. As such, it is expected that the history of the 1,000th millennium Taebong Kingdom can be digitally re-examined through the metaverse environment of Taebong Kingdom and King Gungye Artificial Intelligence Digital Human. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","AI; Digital human; King Gungye; Metaverse; Taebong Kingdom",,,,,,"Korea University, KU","Acknowledgements.

Traditional retinal fundus image classification requires visual inspection by the professionals, which is time consuming and requires expert's knowledge. Earlier identification of retinal diseases is essential to delay or avoid vision deterioration and vision loss. The recently developed artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) models can be employed for accurate retinal image classification. With this motivation, this study designs a new artificial intelligence with optimal deep convolutional neural network (AI-ODCNN) technique for retinal fundus image classification. Primarily, the proposed model uses the Gaussian Blur based noise removal and contrast enhancement technique (CLAHE) based contrast enhancement technique to pre-process the retinal fundus image. In addition, morphology and contour based image segmentation is performed. Moreover, the deep CNN with RMSProp Optimizer is employed for retinal fundus image classification. A wide range of simulations was performed on the automated retinal image analysis and structured analysis of the retina and the outcomes are examined with respect to various measures. The simulation outcomes ensured the better performance of the proposed approach related to other recent algorithms with maximum accuracy of 96.47%. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","computer aided diagnosis;

In both of the reference trajectory tracking guidance and predictor-corrector guidance, flight corridor parameters need to be designed based on manual experience in advance. In this paper, we propose to break through the constraint of ""conical"" flight path envelope, which is common in traditional guidance methods, by taking the natural advantage of reinforcement learning in intelligent decision making. Under the premise of satisfying dynamic equations and hard conditions such as heating rate, load factor and dynamic pressure, a large number of ""trial-and-error"" interactions can be taken between the aircraft and environment. Effective reward is set by referring to the human? s idea of adjusting learning strategies based on feedback. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm in reinforcement learning is employed to train the bank angle guidance model, so as to generate bank angle instruction online based on real-time state information. The ""new quality"" flight corridor is explored, which is completely different from the traditional guidance method. Monte Carlo simulation analysis verifies that the intelligent guidance technology based on reinforcement learning can fully exploit the advantage of wide range flight of aircraft and further expand the flight profile of aircraft. © 2022 AAAS Press of Chinese Society of Aeronautics and Astronautics.

A DT in health care is not a single technology but a domain-adapted multimodal modeling approach incorporating the acquisition, management, analysis, prediction, and interpretation of data, aiming to improve medical decision-making. However, there are many challenges and barriers that must be overcome before a DT can be used in health care. In this viewpoint paper, we build on the current literature, address these challenges, and describe a dynamic DT in health care for optimizing individual patient health care journeys, specifically for women at risk for cardiovascular complications in the preconception and pregnancy periods and across the life course. We describe how we can commit multiple domains to developing this DT. With our cross-domain definition of the DT, we aim to define future goals, trade-offs, and methods that will guide the development of the dynamic DT and implementation strategies in health care. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

However, the existing research primarily concerns exploring the application areas and improving the recognition accuracy. How to apply AI with suitable and user-acceptable forms to realize cognitive health assessment is still a significant challenge. In this paper, we conduct a series of field studies to research this challenging problem. Specifically, inspired by clinically validated cognition assessment test—Trail Making Test (TMT), we design two variants of TMT for objective quantitative assessment, including camera-based TMT (cTMT) and touchscreen-based TMT (tTMT). Each form of variants provides three different analysis perspectives. We conduct user studies on 268 subjects to verify their effectiveness. Experimental results show that both variants can achieve satisfactory discrimination accuracy by optimizing the assessment model, but different application forms and analysis perspectives can adapt to different users. © 2022, China Computer Federation (CCF).","Artifical intelligence; Cognitive health; Human-centered","Application area; Artifical intelligence; Cognitive health; Field studies; Health assessments; Human-centered; Power; Quantitative assessments; Recognition accuracy; Trail making tests; Health care",,,,,"SDAICT2191010; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 61972383; National Key Research and Development Program of China, NKRDPC: 2018YFC2001700","This work is supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (2018YFC2001700), by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant (No.61972383), by the Innovative Research Program of Shandong Academy of Intelligent Computing Technology under (SDAICT2191010).",,,,,,,,,,"Abràmoff, M.D., Lavin, P.T., Birch, M., Shah, N., Folk, J.C., Pivotal trial of an autonomous ai-based diagnostic system for detection of diabetic retinopathy in primary care offices (2018) NPJ Digital Med., 1 (1), pp. 1-8; Arnett, J.A., Labovitz, S.S., Effect of physical layout in performance of the trail making test (1995) Psychol.

However, the complex anatomy of the thoracic aorta impedes TAD detection. We investigated the performance of a deep learning (DL) prototype as a secondary reading tool built to measure TA diameters in a large-scale cohort. Material and methods: Consecutive contrast-enhanced (CE) and non-CE chest CT exams with “normal” TA diameters according to their radiology reports were included. The DL-prototype (AIRad, Siemens Healthineers, Germany) measured the TA at nine locations according to AHA guidelines. Dilatation was defined as >45 mm at aortic sinus, sinotubular junction (STJ), ascending aorta (AA) and proximal arch and >40 mm from mid arch to abdominal aorta. A cardiovascular radiologist reviewed all cases with TAD according to AIRad. Multivariable logistic regression (MLR) was used to identify factors (demographics and scan parameters) associated with TAD classification by AIRad. Results: 18,243 CT scans (45.7% female) were successfully analyzed by AIRad. Mean age was 62.3 ± 15.9 years and 12,092 (66.3%) were CE scans. AIRad confirmed normal diameters in 17,239 exams (94.5%) and reported TAD in 1,004/18,243 exams (5.5%). Review confirmed TAD classification in 452/1,004 exams (45.0%, 2.5% total), 552 cases were false-positive but identification was easily possible using visual outputs by AIRad. MLR revealed that the following factors were significantly associated with correct TAD classification by AIRad: TAD reported at AA [odds ratio (OR): 1.12, p < 0.001] and STJ (OR: 1.09, p = 0.002), TAD found at >1 location (OR: 1.42, p = 0.008), in CE exams (OR: 2.1–3.1, p < 0.05), men (OR: 2.4, p = 0.003) and patients presenting with higher BMI (OR: 1.05, p = 0.01). Overall, 17,691/18,243 (97.0%) exams were correctly classified. Conclusions: AIRad correctly assessed the presence or absence of TAD in 17,691 exams (97%), including 452 cases with previously missed TAD independent from contrast protocol. These findings suggest its usefulness as a secondary reading tool by improving report quality and efficiency.

Methods: Our IRB approved HIPAA-compliant study included 113 adults (71±8 years; 47 females, 66 males) who had both non-contrast chest CT and pulmonary function tests performed within a span of 2 months. The disease severity was classified based on the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1 as % of predicted) into mild, moderate, and severe. 2 thoracic radiologists (RA), blinded to the clinical and AI results, graded severity of emphysema on a 5-point scale suggested by the Fleischner Society for each lobe. The whole lung scores were derived from the summation of lobar scores. Thin-section CT images were processed with the AI-Rad Companion Chest prototype (Siemens Healthineers) to quantify low attenuation areas (LAA < - 950 HU) in whole lung and each lobe separately. Bronchial abnormality was assessed by both radiologists and a fully automated software (Philips Healthcare). Results: Both AI (AUC of 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68 – 0.85) and RA (AUC: 0.76, 95% CI: 0.65 – 0.84) emphysema quantification could differentiate mild, moderate, and severe disease based on FEV1. There was a strong positive correlation between AI and RA (r = 0.72 – 0.80; p <0.001). The combination of emphysema and bronchial abnormality quantification from radiologists’ and AI assessment could differentiate between different severities with AUC of 0.80 – 0.82 and 0.87, respectively. Conclusion: The assessed AI-prototypes can predict the disease severity in patients with emphysema with the same predictive value as the radiologists. © 2021 The Association of University Radiologists","Artifical Intelligence; Bronchial Abnormality; Chest CT; Emphysema","aged; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; attenuation; body weight; bronchus disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; current smoker; digital imaging and communications in medicine; disease severity; electronic medical record; ex-smoker; female; forced expiratory volume; health care facility; health care quality; human; lobar bronchus; lung emphysema; lung function test; lung lobe; major clinical study; male; model based iterative reconstruction; non-smoker; performance; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; radiologist; retrospective study; thin-section computed tomography; thorax; adult; artificial intelligence; diagnostic imaging; emphysema; lung; procedures; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Emphysema; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Pulmonary Emphysema; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",,,"GE Discovery 750 HD, GE Healthcare","GE Healthcare; Philips; Siemens Healthineers","Siemens Medical Solutions USA","The Human Research Committee of our institutional review board approved our study for retrospective analyses of clinical and radiological data on patients with COPD (Protocol number: 2016P000767). 1 study coinvestigator received a research grant from Siemens Healthineers and Riverain Tech Inc. for unrelated projects.

The AEFA is inspired by Coulomb’s law of electrostatic force and has a high speed and optimization accuracy. Because the traditional HC method cannot perform global search tracking and instead performs local search tracking, the AEFA is used for a global search in the proposed HC-AEFA. The critical advantage of the HC-AEFA is that it is desirable performing local and global searches. The proposed hybrid method is implemented to derive an MPP by tuning the converter duty cycle, considering the objective function for maximizing the PV system extracted power. Its capability is evaluated and compared with well-known particle swarm optimization (PSO), considering standards, PSCs, and radiation changes conditions. The tracking efficiency for the most challenging shading pattern (third pattern) using the HC-AEFA, HC, AEFA and PSO is obtained at 99.93, 90.35, 98.85, 99.80%, respectively. The analysis of the population-based optimization process for different algorithms proved the HC-AEFA faster convergence at lower iterations than the other methods. So, the superiority of the proposed HC-AEFA subjected to different patterns is confirmed with higher tracking efficiency and global power peak, fewer fluctuations, higher convergence speed, and higher dynamic and Static-efficiency compared to the other methods.

Methods: This multicenter study retrospectively studied gray-scale ultrasound breast images enrolled from two Chinese hospitals. The data are divided into training, validation, internal testing and external testing set. Three-hundreds images were randomly selected for the physician-AI comparison. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the diagnose error of physicians and models under P=0.05 and 0.10 significance level. The specificity, sensitivity, accuracy, area under the curve (AUC) were used as primary evaluation metrics. Results: A total of 13,684 images of 3447 female patients are finally included. In external test the 224 and 320 REZ achieve the best performance in MobileNet and EfficientNetB0 respectively (AUC: 0.893 and 0.907). Meanwhile, 448 REZ achieve the best performance in Xception, DenseNet121 and ResNet50 (AUC: 0.900, 0.883 and 0.871 respectively). In physician-AI test set, the 320 REZ for EfficientNetB0 (AUC: 0.896, P < 0.1) is better than senior physicians. Besides, the 224 REZ for MobileNet (AUC: 0.878, P < 0.1), 448 REZ for Xception (AUC: 0.895, P < 0.1) are better than junior physicians. While the 448 REZ for DenseNet121 (AUC: 0.880, P < 0.05) and ResNet50 (AUC: 0.838, P < 0.05) are only better than entry physicians. Conclusion: Based on the gray-scale ultrasound breast images, we obtained the best DL combination which was better than the physicians.

Even with so many technological advancements, we still lag in developing a system that can fully digitalize the medical data of each individual and make it readily accessible for both the patient and health worker at any point in time. Moreover, there are also no ways for the government to identify the legitimacy of a particular clinic. This study merges modern technology with traditional approaches, thereby highlighting a scenario where artificial intelligence (AI) merges with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), proposing a way to advance the conventional approaches. The main objective of our research is to provide a one-stop platform for the government, doctors, nurses, and patients to access their data effortlessly. The proposed portal will also check the doctors’ authenticity. Data is one of the most critical assets of an organization, so a breach of data can risk users' lives. Data security is of primary importance and must be prioritized. The proposed methodology is based on cloud computing technology which assures the security of the data and avoids any kind of breach. The study also accounts for the difficulties encountered in creating such an infrastructure in the cloud and overcomes the hurdles faced during the project, keeping enough room for possible future innovations. To summarize, this study focuses on the digitalization of medical data and suggests some possible ways to achieve it. Moreover, it also focuses on some related aspects like security and potential digitalization difficulties. © 2022 Digital Chinese Medicine","Artifical intelligence (AI); Cloud computing; Digitalization; Medical data; One-stop platform; Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Khatib, A., Alkhatib, M.A., Talaei-Khoei, A., Australasian conference on information systems analysis of research in healthcare data analytics (2015) Australasian Conference on Information Systems, pp. 1-16; Zhu, H., Hou, M., , pp. 537-540. , Research on an electronic medical record system based on the internet. 2018 2nd International Conference on Data Science and Business Analytics (ICDSBA), 2018; Kraus, S., Schiavone, F., Pluzhnikova, A., Digital transformation in healthcare: analyzing the current state-of-research (2021) Journal of Business Research, 123, pp. 557-567; Atasoy, H., Greenwood, B.N., Mccullough, J.S., The digitization of patient care: a review of the effects of electronic health records on health care quality and utilization (2019) Annual Review of Public Health, 40, pp. 487-500; Ahmad, I., Bakht, H., Mohan, U., Cloud computing – a comprehensive definition (2017) Journal of Computing and Management Studies, 1 (1), pp. 1-8; Xue, C.T.S., Xin, F.T.W., Benefits and challenges of the adoption of cloud computing in business (2016) International Journal on Cloud Computing: Services and Architecture, 6 (6), pp. 1-15; Akinola, K.E., Odumosu, A.A., Threat handling and security issues in cloud computing (2015) International Journal of Scientific and Engineering Research, 6 (11), pp. 1371-1385; Ometov, A., Molua, O.L., Komarov, M., A survey of security in cloud, edge, and fog computing (2022) Sensors, 22 (3), pp. 1-27; Sriram, G.K., Green cloud computing: an approach towards sustainability (2022) International Research Journal of Modernization in Engineering Technology and Science, 4 (1), pp. 1-5; Srivastava, P., Khan, R., A review paper on cloud computing (2018) International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science and Software Engineering, 8 (6), pp. 17-20; Malasinghe, L.P., Ramzan, N., Dahal, K., Remote patient monitoring: a comprehensive study (2019) Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 10 (1), pp. 57-76; Neelima, M.L., Padma, M., A study on cloud storage (2014) International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing, 35 (5), pp. 966-971; Alexander, C.A., Wang, L., Medication errors: preventing untimely deaths (2014) International Journal of Research in Nursing, 5 (2), pp. 52-60; Kapoor, A., Guha, S., Das, M.K., Digital healthcare: the only solution for better healthcare during COVID-19 pandemic?

The fact that activities happening on DW are completely untraceable has become the main point of attraction for the perpetrators. Also, in certain years, there has been improvement and advancement in the artificial intelligence (AI) as well as machine learning (ML) fields. Therefore, digital security based on AI is of immense benefit for the security industry. Thus, in response to the increasing use of AI and ML technologies, actions were taken against DW crimes, and applications for crime recognition were developed. This chapter is an attempt to discuss and showcase all the different aspects of applications of AI and ML in DW crime recognition. The author sheds light on the enormous benefits of these applications to the security industry as well as the investigators. Considering AI and ML work as double-edged swords in the cyber world, the author also mentions the importance for investigators to understand and practice them carefully. © 2022, IGI Global.

The methods to generate garment models, including three-dimensional auto-generation, three-dimensional visual draping, three-dimensional reconstruction, and three-dimensional modular reorganization were discussed. Surface development techniques such as geometric development, mechanical development, the combination of geometry and mechanics were summarized. The paper illustrates that the digital garment pattern-making technology has great potential in pattern-making simplification, experience-independence, and the transformation between visual three-dimensional modeling and two-dimensional pattern. The potential development direction of digital pattern-making is to improve pattern accuracy, modeling accuracy and efficiency while satisfying the personalization and diversification of clothing by combining human innovation potential and computer computing power. © 2022, Periodical Agency of Journal of Textile Research.

In this regard, the need for neuromorphic hardware that enables training and processing of data generated by edge devices has increased. Different algorithms have been presented in this direction, but they consume a lot of energy and space due to the large number of calculations. Therefore, researchers tried to minimize energy consumption while maintaining accuracy in deep spiking neural networks as the least consuming generation of neural networks. In order to achieve this goal and reduce the number of references to the required memory and space, they have provided various hardware and software methods. In this article, the best architecture is used by examining the amount of energy consumed and the accuracy of different methods of architecture. Also, a hybrid method is proposed to reduce energy consumption in spiking neural networks. The proposed hybrid architecture was implemented on the MNIST dataset, showing that the power consumption is reduced by almost 1% compared to the state of the art architectures. The accuracy of the proposed hybrid algorithm is 95.3%, which is the highest when compared to the architectures using the time-based coding. © 2022 IEEE.","Artifical intelligence; Neuron threshold; Spiking Neural Networks; Time depend coding","Computing power; Data handling; Energy utilization; Network architecture; Network coding; Artifical intelligence; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Cloud-computing; Energy; Hybrid method; Neural-networks; Neuromorphic hardwares; Neuron threshold; Spiking neural network; Time depend coding; Neural networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Maass, W., Networks of spiking neurons: The third generation of neural models (1997) Transactions of the Society for Computer Simulation International, pp. 1659-1671; Taherkhani, A., Li, A.BelatrecheY., Cosma, G., Maguire, L.P., McGinnity, T.M., A review of training in biologically plausible spiking neural networks (2019) Neural Netw, pp. 253-272; Tang, H., Kim, H., Kim, H., Park, J., Spike Counts Based Low Complexity SNN Architecture with Binary Synapse"" in (2019) IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Circuits and Systems, 13 (6), pp. 1664-1677. , Dec; Liu, F., Zhao, W., Chen, Y., Wang, Z., Yang, T., Jiang, L., (2021) SSTDP: Supervised Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity for Efficient Spiking Neural Network Training; Yang, J., Song, T., A Prediction Scheme in Spiking Neural Network (SNN) Hardware for Ultra-low Power Consumption (2020) 2020 International SoC Design Conference (ISOCC), South Korea, pp. 310-311. , oct; Fang, W., Yu, Z., Chen, Y., Masquelier, T., Huang, T., Tian, Y., Incorporating learnable membrane time constant to enhance training of spiking neural networks (2021) ICCV.

The development of deep learning technology is expected to assist farmers in identifying the types of infectious diseases that attack chickens based on feces images so as to increase production yields. Several infectious diseases that attack chickens can be identified through their feces, including newcastle disease caused by a virus, pullorum caused by bacteria, and coccidiosis caused by parasites. To identify, it is necessary to classify the types of diseases that attack by using images of chicken feces. With deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras/TensorFlow, the percentage of images that were accurately predicted according to the classification of infectious diseases suffered by chickens was 95.28% and less accurate was 4.72%. © 2022 IEEE.","Artifical Intelligence; CNN Keras/TensorFlow; Deep Learning; Feces Images; Infectious Disease","Animals; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification; Learning systems; Transfer learning; Viruses; Artifical intelligence; Artificial intelligence technologies; Classification methods; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional neural network keras/tensorflow; Deep learning; Feces image; Increase productions; Infectious disease; Learning technology; Diseases",,,,,,"ACKNOWLEDGMENT The author would like to thank P2KMPM Akademi Komunitas Negeri Putra Sang Fajar Blitar Unit which has funded this research.",,,,,,,,,,"Samuel, A.L., Some studies in machine learning using the game of checkers (1959) Ibm Journal of Research and Development, 44 (1), pp. 210-229. , , 2; Walsh, J., O' Mahony, N., Campbell, S., Carvalho, A., Krpalkova, L., Velasco-Hernandez, G., Harapanahalli, S., Riordan, D., Deep Learning vs (2019) Traditional Computer Vision; Ahmed, G., Malick, R., Akhunzada, A., Zahid, S., Sagri, M., Gani, A., An approach towards iot-based predictive service for early detection of diseases in poultry chickens (2021) Sustainability, 13, p. 13396; (2014) Manual Penyakit Unggas, , Pudjiatmoko, dkk.

But applying MPC requires solving a potentially complex optimization problem online to generate a new control input signal. To avoid the expensive online computations, deep learning-based MPC has been developed, in which neural networks imitate the behavior of the MPC. When such a data-driven approximate controller is derived, there is no straightforward way to trace the reasons for its proposed actions back to its inputs, hence making the controller a black-box model. In this paper, we propose the use of SHAP, an explainable artifical intelligence technique, to generate insights from learning-based MPC for the purpose of model debugging and simplification. Our results show that SHAP can explain general control behaviors and can also support model simplification in an informed way, representing a better alternative to dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis. © 2022 IEEE.","explainable artificial intelligence; machine learning; model predictive control","Controllers; Deep learning; Learning systems; Predictive control systems; Principal component analysis; Complex optimization problems; Control applications; Control inputs; Explainable artificial intelligence; Learning Based Models; Machine-learning; Model predictive controllers; Model-predictive control; Neural-networks; Online computations; Model predictive control",,,,,"Helmholtz Association","This work was supported by the Helmholtz-Einstein International Berlin Research School in Data Science (HEIBRiDS) and the Helmholtz Association under the program “Energy System Design”.",,,,,,,,,,"Chen, Y., Tong, Z., Zheng, Y., Samuelson, H., Norford, L., Transfer learning with deep neural networks for model predictive control of hvac and natural ventilation in smart buildings (2020) Journal of Cleaner Production, 254, p. 119866; Karg, B., Lucia, S., Deep learning-based embedded mixed-integer model predictive control (2018) European Control Conference (ECC, pp. 2075-2080; Ruiz-Moreno, S., Frejo, J.R.D., Camacho, E.F., Model predictive control based on deep learning for solar parabolic-trough plants Renewable Energy, 180 (2021), pp. 193-202; Jeon, B.-K., Kim, E.-J., LSTM-based model predictive control for optimal temperature set-point planning (2021) Sustainability, 13 (2), p. 894; Yang, S., Wan, M.P., Chen, W., Ng, B.F., Dubey, S., Experiment study of machine-learning-based approximate model predictive control for energy-efficient building control Applied Energy, 288 (2021), p. 116648; Wang, G., Jia, Q.-S., Qiao, J., Bi, J., Zhou, M., Deep learning-based model predictive control for continuous stirred-tank reactor system (2020) IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 32 (8), pp. 3643-3652; Ceusters, G., Rodriguez, R.C., Garcia, A.B., Franke, R., Deconinck, G., Helsen, L., Nowe, A., Camargo, L.R., Modelpredictive control and reinforcement learning in multi-energy system case studies Applied Energy, 303 (2021), p. 117634; Brandi, S., Fiorentini, M., Capozzoli, A., Comparison of online and offline deep reinforcement learning with model predictive control for thermal energy management Automation in Construction, 135 (2022), p. 104128; Wang, Z., Hong, T., Reinforcement learning for building controls: The opportunities and challenges (2020) Applied Energy, 269, p. 115036; Schreiber, T., Netsch, C., Baranski, M., Muller, D., Monitoring datadriven reinforcement learning controller training: A comparative study of different training strategies for a real-world energy system Energy and Buildings, 239 (2021), p. 110856; Yoo, H., Kim, B., Kim, J.W., Lee, J.H., Reinforcement learning based optimal control of batch processes using Monte-Carlo deep deterministic policy gradient with phase segmentation Computers & Chemical Engineering, 144 (2021), p. 107133; Karg, B., Lucia, S., Reinforced approximate robust nonlinear model predictive control 23rd International Conference on Process Control, 2021, pp. 149-156; Araujo, T., Helberger, N., Kruikemeier, S., De Vreese, C.H., In AI we trust?

The deployment of CNNs in embedded systems, however, imposes additional constraints such as latency restrictions and limited energy consumption in the sensor platform. These requirements have to be considered during hardware/software co-design of embedded Artifical Intelligence (AI) applications. In addition, the transmission of uncompressed image data from the sensor to a central edge node requires large bandwidth on the link, which must also be taken into account during the design phase.Therefore, we present a simulation toolchain for fast evaluation of hardware-aware CNN partitioning for embedded AI applications. This approach explores an efficient workload distribution between sensor nodes and a central edge node. Neither processing all layers close to the sensor nor transmitting all uncompressed raw data to the edge node is an optimal solution for each use case. Hence, our proposed simulation toolchain evaluates power and performance metrics for each reasonable partitioning point in a CNN. In contrast to the state of the art, our approach does not only consider the neural network architecture. In the evaluation, our simulation toolchain additionally takes into account hardware components such as special accelerators and memories that are implemented in the sensor node.Exemplary, we show the simulation results for three commonly used CNNs in embedded systems. Thereby, we identify advantageous partitioning points regarding inference latency and energy consumption. With the support of the toolchain, we are able to identify three beneficial partitioning points for FCN ResNet-50 and two for GoogLeNet as well as for SqueezeNet V1.1. © 2022 IEEE.","convolutional neural networks; embedded systems; hardware accelerator; hardware/software co-design; simulation toolchain","Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Embedded systems; Hardware-software codesign; Network architecture; Object detection; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Sensor nodes; Artifical intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Edge nodes; Embedded images; Embedded-system; Energy-consumption; Hardware accelerators; Hardware/software codesign; Network inference; Simulation toolchain; Energy utilization",,,,,"Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF: 16ME0096, ZuSE- KI-mobil","This work was funded by the Ger man Federal Ministry of Educa tion and Research (BMBF) under grant number 16ME0096 (ZuSE- KI-mobil).

The difficulties of learning classifiers from imbalanced data is demonstrated in a variety of real-world applications,especially in this era of big data, which has generated more classification tasks. Researchers have taken many existing JIT-SDP efforts to assume that the features of software releases remain costant over time. However, the researchers did not consider that JIT-SDP may be affected by the gradual evolution of class imbalance. Specifically, class imbalance (that is, the number of changes caused by defects is not adequately represented) has been changing over time, and the number of clean class changes and defect class changes may both increase or decrease, so here In this case, the existing JIT-SDP method becomes inapplicable. Taking these factors into consideration, we propose a new imbalanced classification framework, which aims to achieve data class balance by applying a new three-step smart pruning strategy, i.e., first undersampling the majority class, then undersampling the minority class. Oversampling is performed, since the minority class becomes the majority class after oversampling, as a result, the final stage is to intelligently undersample the minority group that eventually becomes the dominant group. Through these three steps, data balance is achieved before classification. Experiments show that this new framework is very computationally efficient, leading to better performance even under highly imbalanced distributions of clean and defective data. At the same time, our proposed framework can also be easily adapted to most existing learning methods to improve their performance on imbalanced data. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.","Artifical Intelligence; Class Imbalance; JIT-SDP; Machine Learning","Classification (of information); Forecasting; Just in time production; Learning systems; Machine learning; Artifical intelligence; Class imbalance; Imbalanced data; JIT-SDP; Just-in-time; Machine-learning; Over sampling; Performance; Software defect prediction; Under-sampling; Defects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Japkowicz, Nathalie, Stephen, Shaju, The class imbalance problem: A systematic study (2002) Intelligent data analysis, 6 (5), pp. 429-449; Chawla, Nitesh V., Bowyer, Kevin W., Hall, Lawrence O., Philip Kegelmeyer, W., SMOTE: synthetic minority over-sampling technique (2002) Journal of artificial intelligence research, 16, pp. 321-357; Han, Hui, Wang, Wen-Yuan, Mao, Bing-Huan, Borderline-SMOTE: a new over-sampling method in imbalanced data sets learning (2005) International Conference on Intelligent Computing, pp. 878-887. , Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg; He, Haibo, Bai, Yang, Garcia, Edwardo A., Li, Shutao, ADASYN: Adaptive synthetic sampling approach for imbalanced learning (2008) Neural Networks, 2008.

Specifically, we introduce the topics of Algorithms, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence, which underpin such decision making. Beginning with some of the classical algorithms that were developed decades ago in Operations Research, we discuss how, today, decision making relies on increasingly massive amounts of data and highly sophisticated and powerful mathematical models. We show how an algorithm helps by either describing the world, forecasting it, or providing the decision-maker with prescriptive recommendations and suggestions to consider. To help readers wanting to dig deeper, we provide a bird's eye view of the fields of Analytics and Artificial Intelligence. We give some examples of the most impactful current approaches, together with a brief overview of the mathematics involved. We then present possible paths in which these tools may transform how supply chains may work and be managed in the future. Most of the presentation aims at providing a brief introduction to the central topics. The intention is to spike interest for further reading.

Many relevant technologies are used in the metaverse to offer 3D immersive and customized experiences at the user's fingertips. Despite the fact that the metaverse receives a lot of attention and advantages, one of the most pressing concerns for its users is the safety of their digital material and data. As a result of its decentralization, immutability, and transparency, blockchain is a possible alternative. Our goal is to conduct a comprehensive assessment of blockchain systems in the metaverse to properly appreciate its function in the metaverse. To begin with, the paper introduces blockchain and the metaverse and explains why it's necessary for the metaverse to adopt blockchain technology. Aside from these technological considerations, this article focuses on how blockchain-based approaches for the metaverse may be used from a privacy and security standpoint. There are several technological challenegs that need to be addressed for making the metaverse a reality. The influence of blockchain on important key technologies with in metaverse, such as Artifical Intelligence, big data and the Internet-of-Things (IoT) is also examined. Several prominent initiatives are also shown to demonstrate the importance of blockchain technology in the development of metaverse apps and services. There are many possible possibilities for future development and research in the application of blockchain technology in the metaverse. © 2022 IEEE.","Blockchain; Metaverse; Privacy; Vertical Applications","Internet of things;

These have been widely documented to have positive effects on the specific technical skills training on their respective field of users. However, in the area of simulators for driving education, there has been a lack of a comprehensive survey which encompasses the various contributions in this area. In this paper, we fill that gap by providing a review of previous work in literature that focuses on driver’s education using simulators. In addition, we include also works on Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Computational Intelligence (CI) in games that could be used to enhance the project and the effects of implementation of virtual reality in such studies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","AI techniques; CI techniques; Driving education; Driving simulator; Virtual reality","Artificial intelligence; Automobile simulators; E-learning; Artifical intelligence; Artifical intelligence technique; Computational intelligence techniques; Driver education; Driving education; Driving simulator; Medical training; Real-world; Technical skills; Virtual worlds; Virtual reality",,,,,"FRGS/1/2020/SS0/MMU/02/1","Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank the Ministry of Education of Malaysia in providing financial support for this work through the Fundamental Research Grant Scheme (FRGS/1/2020/SS0/MMU/02/1)",,,,,,,,,,"Agrawal, R., Knodler, M., Fisher, D.L., Samuel, S., Virtual reality headset training: Can it be used to improve young drivers’ latent hazard anticipation and mitigation skills (2018) Transportation Research Record, 2672 (33), pp. 20-30; Aiolli, F., Palazzi, C.E., Enhancing artificial intelligence in games by learning the opponent’s playing style (2008) New Frontiers for Entertainment Computing, pp. 1-10. , Ciancarini P, Nakatsu R, Rauterberg M, Roccetti M, Springer, US, Boston, MA, pp; Backlund, P., Engström, H., Johannesson, M., Lebram, M., Games for traffic education: An experimental study of a game-based driving simulator (2010) Simul Gaming, 41, pp. 145-169; Burkhardt JM, Corneloup V, Garbay C, Bourrier Y, Jambon F, Luengo V, Job A, Cabon P, Benab-bou A, Lourdeaux D (2016) Simulation and virtual reality-based learning of non-technical skills in driving: critical situations, diagnostic and adaptation.

For this reason, there are many studies on public transportation which mostly answer the question of “when my next bus will arrive?”. However now when the public is under the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic and learning to live with new social rules such as “social distance” a new yet crucial question arise on public transportation: “how crowded my next bus will be?” To prevent the crowdedness in public transportation the traffic regulators need to forecast the number of passengers the day ahead. In this study, in cooperation with Synteda, we suggest a machine learning algorithm that forecasts the occupancy in a bus or tram the day ahead for each stop for a route. The input data is past passenger travel data provided by the Västtrafik AB which is the public transportation company in Gothenburg, Sweden. The hourly data for the precipitation and temperature also has been added to the forecasting method; the database of precipitation and temperature is obtained by the SMHI, Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Artifical intelligence; Forecasting; Machine learning; Public transport; SVR","Bus transportation; Buses; Intelligent systems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Artifical intelligence; Day-ahead; Machine-learning; Public IS; Public transport; Public transportation; Social distance; Social rules; Sustainable cities; SVR; Forecasting",,,,,,"We would like to thank to Västtrafik for the data provided.

Big Data and AI applications are implemented in Java, Scala, Python and other languages that are not widely used in High-Performance Computing (HPC) which is still dominated by C and Fortran. Moreover, they are based on dedicated environments such as Hadoop or Spark which are difficult to integrate with the traditional HPC management systems. We have developed the Parallel Computing in Java (PCJ) library, a tool for scalable high-performance computing and Big Data processing in Java. In this paper, we present the basic functionality of the PCJ library with examples of highly scalable applications running on the large resources. The performance results are presented for different classes of applications including traditional computational intensive (HPC) workloads (e.g. stencil), as well as communication-intensive algorithms such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We present implementation details and performance results for Big Data type processing running on petascale size systems.

It includes machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), which can automatically obtain information from the database through algorithms and make predictions. It has been widely used in medicine, especially in the cardiovascular field. In this review, we made a brief overview of AI, as well as the application of AI in the cardiac radiology to noninvasively detect myocardial ischemia. At the same time, we summarized the current limitations and prospects of AI in the field of myocardial ischemia. Finally, AI can accomplish the task of image recognition very well, and make accurate judgments with the same effectiveness as cardiologists or imaging experts. © 2021 ACM.","Artificial intelligence; Cardiac radiology; Machine learning; Myocardial ischemia","Deep learning; Image recognition; Radiology; Artifical intelligence; Cardiac radiology; Current limitation; Myocardial ischemia; Radiation",,,,,,"Thanks for the support provided by the Cardiovascular Smart Diagnosis and Treatment Engineering Center",,,,,,,,,,"Howard, J., Artificial intelligence: Implications for the future of work (2019) Am J Ind Med, 62 (11), pp. 917-926; McCarthy, J., Minsky, M.L., Rochester, N., A proposal for the dartmouth summer research project on artificial intelligence, August 31, 1955 (2006) AI Magazine, 27 (4), p. 12; Roth, G.A., Mensah, G.A., Johnson, C.O., Global burden of cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, 1990-2019: Update from the gbd 2019 study (2020) J Am Coll Cardiol, 76 (25), pp. 2982-3021; Pepine, C.J., Anderson, R.D., Sharaf, B.L., Coronary microvascular reactivity to adenosine predicts adverse outcome in women evaluated for suspected ischemia results from the national heart, lung and blood institute wise (women's ischemia syndrome evaluation) study (2010) J Am Coll Cardiol, 55 (25), pp. 2825-2832; Russel, L., Stuart, J., (2014) Artificial Intelligence : A Modern Approach, , 3rd. ed., Pearson new international ed [M].

The rapid development of artifical intelligence and deep learning has put forward an urgent demand for the computing capacities. In the traditional von Neumann architecture, the physical separation between memory and computing units results in power consumption wall and memory wall problems. Besides, Moore's law is gradually slowing down. Photonic neuromorphic computing, which fully combines the characteristics of high-speed optical communication, optical interconnection, optical integration, silicon-based optoelectronics and neuromorphic computing, has the advantages of ultra-high speed, large bandwidth and multi-dimension. It has wide application prospects in the fields of high-performance computing and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, it is a highly competitive solution that breaks through the limits of traditional microelectronics computing in the post-Moore era. This article reviews the work of the main research teams at home and abroad on the theory, algorithms, and devices of photonic neurons, synapses, and neural networks, and puts forward a prospect. © 2021, Science Press.

Firstly, the data set generated by EnergyPlus energy consumption simulation software is used as the training set and test set of the Biased ReLU neural network (BRNN). Secondly, the building energy consumption prediction model and indoor temperature prediction model are built based on the Biased ReLU neural network. Thirdly, model predictive control (MPC) is uesd to achieve energy saving by controlling the set temperature of the building's Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. Finally, the joint simulation of MATLAB and EnergyPlus is realized by introducing the building control virtual test bed (BCVTB).

It is of great significance to summarize the metallogenic model and geophysical exploration development in the northern and southern margins of Qaidam Basin, and to make a breakthrough in prospection of deep resources. The genesis of deposit around the northern and southern margins of Qaidam Basin is dominated by exhalative sedimentary polymetallic deposit, magmatic dissociative Ni-Cu-Co deposit, sedimentary Fe deposit, stratabound Pb-Zn deposit and hydrothermal polymetallic deposit. The metallogenetic epoch of deposits can be divided into four periods, including Precambrian, early and middle period of Early Paleozoic, Late Paleozoic and Mesozoic; and the metallogenic dynamic mechanisms include extension, compression and local extension-compression. There are obvious physical differences between orebody and host rock. According to the different physical distribution and metallogenic geological conditions in the northern and southern margins of Qaidam Basin, the effective geophysical methods such as gravity, magnetic, electrical and seismic methods are selected, and a certain deposits have been discovered. Three typical mining areas including Xiarihamu Ni-Cu deposit, Xitieshan Pb-Zn deposit and Yemaquan Fe-polymetallic deposit are taken as examples to analyze the present progress of mineral resources geology and geophysical prospecting in Qaidam Basin. The future direction of geophysics is to develop mobile platform detection, theory and technology of multi-resolution electromagnetic detection, joint inversion technology of integrated geophysical data, and technology of artifical intelligence and cloud computing. © 2021, Editorial Department of Journal of Earth Sciences and Environment.

""Winning by faster based on Observation-Orientation-Decision-Action (OODA)"" has become an important mechanism for victory in modern wars. As the battlefield environment is going more and more complex and the confrontation is extending into variable domains and dimensions, the mapping relationship from battlefield situation to combat strategy becomes extremely complicated, posing new challenges to the OODA loop. To ensure that the OODA loop meets the task requirements, the OODA loop theory is combined with Artifical Intelligence(AI) to drive efficient operation of each loop and shorten the OODA loop time, so as to provide key support for winning the war. This paper summarizes the progress of application of AI in the military field, and analyzes the challenges of OODA empowered with AI. Then, preliminary thoughts on systematic development of the related technology involved in the OODA loop is put forward to support the development of intelligent missiles. © 2021, Beihang University Aerospace Knowledge Press.

Most of the world’s jurisdiction are demanding for a “human being” as a condition sinequanone of the capability of being author or inventor of something. But, as we see in this article, this does not result from the black letter of the law but from interpretation, whether it is judges or the doctrine that interprets the law. Hence, as of today, whether it is in the E.U. or in Europe, there is nothing preventing AI in the black letter of the law from being recognized as inventor and author of what they created. You should, however, be aware that all these talks are for futuristic AIs. AIs that will be able to create on their own, without the involvement of humans asking for tasks. Those AIs do not exist yet. Those AIs are what we will call strong AI. And we can be sure that they will exist one day. In this article, we propose that AIs enjoy a legal personhood. A new personhood that does not gives “human rights” but that will allow us to set the cadre juridique that surrounded AI and that is really necessary. © 2021 The Institute for Migrant Rights Press.","International Law; Internet Law; Law and Technology",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110669697

The correlation coefficient of observed and simulated values was evaluated by the R2 criterion, simulation error was evaluated by the root mean square error (RMSE), and MB criteria and model efficiency were evaluated by the Nash-Sutcliffe method. The results show that the correlation coefficients in the GEP model based on daily data from Urmia station and monthly data from Diata station are 23 and 58%, respectively, and R2 in simulation with GEP is estimated to be 55% lower than with the other two models. The R2 range in both ANFIS and SVM models varies from 91 to 93%. On average, the RMSE values in the GEP simulation are 50% and 55% higher than the ANFIS ratio for daily and monthly data at the two stations, respectively, and the RMSE values of ANFIS model are 1% and 3% higher than those of the SVM at Urmia and Diata stations, respectively. The bias values of the GEP model are 72% and 60% higher than those of ANFIS at Urmia and Diata stations, respectively. The GEP efficiency factors are 56% and 61% lower than those of ANFIS at Urmia and Diata stations, respectively. And the ANFIS efficiency ratio is 1 and 2% lower than SVM in Urmia and Diata stations, respectively. Therefore, rainfall simulation with the SVM model is associated with a lower error rate and better efficiency, the ANFIS model is close to the efficiency of SVM, and the GEP model is not suitable for rainfall simulation. © 2021, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Methods: The current study retrospectively analyzed the clinical and CT data of 438 patients with COVID-19 between January 2020 and March 2020 in Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science & Technology. The clinical types included common type (n=146), severe type (n=247) and critical type (n=45). The chest CT indexes of all patients were quantitatively analyzed by artificial intelligence (AI) deep learning, including whole lung volume, CT lung opacification, ground glass opacification volume (GGO volume; CT value<-300 HU), solid opacification volume (SO volume; CT value ≥-300 HU) and the ratio of volume to the whole lung volume, the ratio of SO volume to GGO volume (SO volume/GGO volume). Kruskal-Wallis test was used to conduct statistical analysis of the differences in quantitative parameters among clinical types, and multiple ordered logistic regression was used to analyze the correlation between quantitative parameters and clinical types. Results: Among the 438 patients diagnosed with COVID-19, severe and critical patients were older (P<0.05), and most of the critical patients were male (P<0.05). The main clinical manifestations of all clinical types were fever, followed by cough, fatigue, chest tightness, dyspnea, gastrointestinal symptoms and so on. GGO volume was the main CT manifestation of all the three clinical subtypes. The whole-lung opacification volume, GGO volume, SO volume and their proportions in whole-lung volume significantly increased from common, severe to critical types (all P<0.05). SO volume/GGO volume increased with the severity of clinical type [common type 0.12 (0.03, 0.34), severe type 0.29 (0.11, 0.59), critical type 0.61 (0.39, 0.97)]. Multiple ordered logistic regression analysis showed that whole-lung opacification volume (OR=1.009), SO volume/GGO volume (OR=1.866), GGO volume (OR=1.008) and SO volume (OR=1.016) had a significant positive effect on the severity of clinical typing (P<0.01). Conclusion: Quantitative indicators of chest CT based on deep learning algorithm (SO volume, GGO volume, SO volume/GGO volume) are closely related to the clinical severity of COVID-19. © 2021 Chinese Medical Association","Artifical intelligence; COVID-19; Tomography, X-ray computed","adult; Article; chest tightness; clinical classification; clinical feature; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; correlational study; coughing; deep learning; dyspnea; fatigue; female; fever; gastrointestinal symptom; ground glass opacity; human; injury severity; lung injury; lung volume; machine learning; major clinical study; male; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; thorax radiography; x-ray computed tomography",,,,,"Huazhong University of Science and Technology, HUST: 2020kfyXGYJ014","Wuhan Science and Technology Planning Project 2018060401011326; New Pneumonia Emergency Science and Technology Project in Hubei Province 2020FCA021; Huazhong University of Science and Technology COVID-19 Emergency Technology Project 2020kfyXGYJ014",,,,,,,,,,"http://www.nhc.gov.cn, 中华人民共和国国家卫生健康委员会.新型冠状病毒肺炎诊疗方案(试行第七版)[EB/OL].

In the last ten years, due to innovative development, the quantity of data has grown exponentially. For frequent Itemset (FIs) mining applications, it imposes new challenges. Misconceived information may be found in recent algorithms, including both threshold and size based algorithms. Threshold value plays a central role in generating frequent itemsets from the given dataset. Selecting a support threshold value is very complicated for those unaware of the dataset's characteristics. The performance of algorithms for finding FIs without the support threshold is, however, deficient due to heavy computation. Therefore, we have proposed a method to discover FIs without the support threshold, called Top-k frequent itemsets mining (TKFIM). It uses class equivalence and set-theory concepts for mining FIs. The proposed procedure does not miss any FIs; thus, accurate frequent patterns are mined. Furthermore, the results are compared with state-of-the-art techniques such as Top-k miner and Build Once and Mine Once (BOMO). It is found that the proposed TKFIM has outperformed the results of these approaches in terms of execution and performance, achieving 92.70, 35.87, 28.53, and 81.27 percent gain on Top-k miner using Chess, Mushroom, and Connect and T1014D100K datasets, respectively. Similarly, it has achieved a performance gain of 97.14, 100, 78.10, 99.70 percent on BOMO using Chess, Mushroom, Connect, and T1014D100K datasets, respectively. Therefore, it is argued that the proposed procedure may be adopted on a large dataset for better performance. © 2021 Iqbal et al.

Methodology The overview is based on a thematic literature review. It is guided by the principles of biomedical ethics together with the concept of epistemic (in)justice. Results In addition to a risk-benefit analysis, (digital) health literacy, equity of access, issues of under- or misuse of care, and an adaptation of informed consent need to be considered. Conclusion The ethical assessment of autonomous AI in psychotherapy remains open; too many clinical, ethical, legal, and practical questions remain to be addressed. Quality criteria for AI application as well as guidelines for its clinical use need to be developed before wider clinical implementation. © 2021 Georg Thieme Verlag.

Risk models for predicting prolonged LOS and post-acute care have limited accuracy. Our goal was to develop and validate models using artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict prolonged LOS > 7days and need for post-acute care after PCI. Methods: We defined prolonged LOS as ≥7 days and post-acute care as patients discharged to: extended care, transitional care unit, rehabilitation, other acute care hospital, nursing home or hospice care. Data from 22 675 patients who presented with ACS and underwent PCI was shuffled and split into a derivation set (75% of dataset) and a validation dataset (25% of dataset). Calibration plots were used to examine the overall predictive performance of the MLP by plotting observed and expected risk deciles and fitting a lowess smoother to the data. Classification accuracy was assessed by a receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the ROC curve (AUC). Results: Our MLP-based model predicted prolonged LOS with an accuracy of 90.87% and 88.36% in training and test sets, respectively. The post-acute care model had an accuracy of 90.22% and 86.31% in training and test sets, respectively. This accuracy was achieved with quick convergence. Predicted probabilities from the MLP models showed good (prolonged LOS) to excellent calibration (post-acute care). Conclusions: Our ANN-based models accurately predicted LOS and need for post-acute care. Larger studies for replicability and longitudinal studies for evidence of impact are needed to establish these models in current PCI practice. © 2020 Stichting European Society for Clinical Investigation Journal Foundation.

Since access to consumer data is challenging at the beginning of the day and time-consuming. But in recent days due to advancement in internet technology the collection of data related to customer and products are enormous. With the efficient analysis of customer data lead to better opportunities in decision making and also to recognize high-risk customer profile that can reduce the risk of loss by taking action into account. In this research, a machine learning methodology is applied to conduct consumer analysis using Naïve Bayes. But due to the presence of redundant, missing and noisy variables in data sets, Naïve Bayes can perform poorly in the prediction of performance. In order to eliminate the correlated and unnecessary attributes in the dataset and to enhance model efficiency, a hybrid feature selection (HFS-IGFS) approach is applied to get the best optimal feature subset for modeling with Naïve Bayes. The experiment procedure is conducted using bank datasets obtained from UCI repository and results are compared between the naïve Bayes with (Filter, wrapper and HFS approach) and Naïve Bayes without HFS. The experimental results reveal HFS chooses best subset of attributes with reduced computational time and also increase in NB performance prediction is achieved. © 2021 IEEE.","Artifical Intelligence; Customer analysis; Machine Learning; Naive Bayes; Predictio","Barium compounds; Cellular radio systems; Decision making; Feature extraction; Mobile telecommunication systems; Risk assessment; Sales; Sodium compounds; Turing machines; Wireless networks; Computational time; Consumer expectations; Customer profiles; Efficient analysis; Hybrid feature selections; Internet technology; Performance prediction; Prediction of performance; Consumer behavior",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Azhagusundai, B., Selvadoss Thanamani, A., Feature selection based on information gain (2013) IJITEE, 2 (2). , Jan; Prabha Krishnamuthi, D., Ilango, Customer behavior analysis using rough set approach (2013) Jtaer, 8 (2), pp. 21-33. , August; Dash, M., Liu, H., Feature selection for classification Intelligent Data Analysis, 1 (1-4), pp. 131-156; Gheyas, I.A., Smith, L.S., Feature subset selection in large dimensionality domains (2010) Pat Tern Recognition, 43 (1), pp. 5-13; Hajek, P., Michalak, K., Feature selection in corporate credit rat ing prediction (2013) Knowledge-Based Systems, 51, pp. 72-84; Hsu, H.-H., Hsieh, C.-W., Lu, M.-D., Hybrid feature selection by combining filters and wrappers (2011) Exp Syst.

Artificial intelligence (AI) brings a new solution to overcome these challenges with intelligent strategies. A new AI technology-based method, named SADA, is proposed in this paper for the prediction of dynamic responses of FOWTs. Firstly, the methodology of SADA is introduced with the selection of Key Disciplinary Parameters (KDPs). The AI module in SADA was built in a coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic in-house program DARwind and the policy decision is provided by the machine learning algorithms deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG). Secondly, a set of basin experimental results of a Hywind Spar-type FOWT were employed to train the AI module. SADA weights KDPs by DDPG algorithms' actor network and changes their values according to the training feedback of 6DOF motions of Hywind platform through comparing the DARwind simulation results and that of experimental data. Many other dynamic responses that cannot be measured in basin experiment could be predicted in higher accuracy with this intelligent DARwind. Finally, the case study of SADA method was conducted and the results demonstrated that the mean values of the platform's motions can be predicted by AI-based DARwind with higher accuracy, for example the maximum error of surge motion is reduced by 21%. This proposed SADA method takes advantage of numerical-experimental method and the machine learning method, which brings a new and promising solution for overcoming the handicap impeding direct use of traditional basin experimental technology in FOWTs design. © Copyright © 2021 Chen, Chen and Hu.","artifical intelligence (AI); basin experiment; DARwind; floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT); machine learning; reinforcement learning (RL); software in the loop (SIL) simulation",,,,,,"Newcastle University","This project was supported by Marine, Offshore and Subsea Technology Group at School of Engineering, Newcastle University, United Kingdom.",,,,,,,,,,"Alpaydin, E., (2020) Introduction to Machine Learning, , MIT press; Andreaus, U., Baragatti, P., Placidi, L.J.I.J.O.N.L.M., Experimental and numerical investigations of the responses of a cantilever beam possibly contacting a deformable and dissipative obstacle under harmonic excitation (2016) Int.

However, these models can reproduce and explain only a limited range of typical phenomena in classical conditioning. Based on existing biological findings concerning classical conditioning, we build a brain-inspired classical conditioning (BICC) model. Compared with other computational models, our BICC model can reproduce as many as 15 classical experiments, explaining a broader set of findings than other models have, and offers better computational explainability for both the experimental phenomena and the biological mechanisms of classical conditioning. Finally, we validate our theoretical model on a humanoid robot in three classical conditioning experiments (acquisition, extinction, and reacquisition) and a speed generalization experiment, and the results show that our model is computationally feasible as a foundation for brain-inspired robot classical conditioning. © 2020 The Author(s)","artificial intelligence; cognitive neuroscience; Neuroscience; robotics",,,,,,"ZDBS-LY-JSC013; Chinese Academy of Sciences, CAS: XDB32070100; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST: 2020AAA0104305; Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission, BMSTC: Z181100001518006; China Electronics Technology Group Corporation, CETC: 6141B08010103","This work is supported by the Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. XDB32070100 ), the new generation of artificial intelligence major project of the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (Grant No. 2020AAA0104305 ), the Beijing Municipal Commission of Science and Technology (Grant No. Z181100001518006 ), the Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS (Grant No. ZDBS-LY-JSC013 ), the CETC Joint Fund (Grant No. 6141B08010103 ), and the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence ( BAAI ).",,,,,,,,,,"Angulo, R., Bustamante, J., Estades, V., Ramirez, V., Jorquera, B., Sex differences in cue competition effects with a conditioned taste aversion preparation (2020) Front.

Additionally, alternative technologies are either uncomfortable and stressful, or expensive. Now, despite the great scientific advances in the area, there is still a pressing need for an automated robust, inexpensive and (sub)optimal technology to monitor animal behavior in a cost-effective, contact-less and stress-free fashion. Overall, this niche can leverage the benefits of Deep Learning schemes.Objective: This review aims to provide a systematic overview of most current projects in the area of comfort monitoring dairy cattle, as well as their corresponding image recognition-based techniques and technologies.Methods: First, a systematic review planning was carried out, and objectives, research questions, search strings, among others, were defined. Subsequently,a broad survey was conducted to extract, analyze and compile the data, to generate a easy-to-read visual source of information (tables and graphics).Results: Information was extracted from the reviewed papers. Among this data collected from the papers are techniques utilized, target behaviors, cow bodyparts identified in visual computational, besides their paper source font, the publication date, and localization. For example, the papers present are mostly recent. China has had a larger number of relevant papers in the area. The back was the body region most analyzed by the papers and the behaviors most analyzed were body condition score, lameness, cow's body position and feeding/drinking behavior. Among the methods used is RCNN Inception V3 with the best accuracy for cow's back region.Conclusion: The aim of this work is to present some of the papers that are being carried out in the area of dairy cow behavior monitoring, using techniques of Artifical Intelligence. It is expected that the information collected and presented in the present systematic review paper contribute to the future researches and projects of the area and the application of new techniques. © 2021 IEEE.","behavioral tracking; computer vision; dairy cows; welfare monitoring","Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Deep learning; Image recognition; Paper; Alternative technologies; Behavioral tracking; Control monitoring; Dairy cattles; Dairy cow; Gross domestic products; Manual monitoring; Systematic literature review; Systematic Review; Welfare monitoring; Computer vision",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Van Asseldonk, M., Jalvingh, A., Huirne, R., Dijkhuizen, A., Potential economic benefits from changes in management via information technology applications on dutch dairy farms: A simulation study (1999) Livestock production science, 60 (1), pp. 33-44; Doyle, R., Moran, J., (2015) Cow talk: understanding dairy cow behaviour to improve their welfare on asian farms, , Csiro Publishing; Polsky, L., Von Keyserlingk, M.A., Invited review: Effects of heat stress on dairy cattle welfare (2017) Journal of dairy science, 100 (11), pp. 8645-8657; Bikker, J., Van Laar, H., Rump, P., Doorenbos, J., Van Meurs, K., Griffioen, G., Dijkstra, J., Evaluation of an ear-attached movement sensor to record cow feeding behavior and activity (2014) Journal of dairy science, 97 (5), pp. 2974-2979; Heo, E.-J., Ahn, S.-J., Choi, K.-S., Real-time cattle action recognition for estrus detection (2019) TIIS, 13 (4), pp. 2148-2161; Zhao, K., Shelley, A.N., Lau, D.L., Dolecheck, K.A., Bewley, J.M., Automatic body condition scoring system for dairy cows based on depth-image analysis (2020) International Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering, 13 (4), pp. 45-54; Shiiya, K., Otsuka, F., Zin, T.T., Kobayashi, I., Image-based feeding behavior detection for dairy cow (2019) 2019 IEEE 8th Global Conference on Consumer Electronics (GCCE).

This world is inhabited by characters, players and objects. Prior to the commencement of play, the Dungeon Master prepares not only the rules of the world but an account of historical events and the current world state. While the rules provide the player with boundaries of play, the character sheets store the current player state, and the back story provides context for the happenings during the game session. Consider how often a story is told where, “In a land far away lived…”. Rarely does a story rely on a universe where all existents are spontaneously spawned into being. Instead, vast historical worlds with cultures, histories and languages are created. This context provides the reader/viewer/player with an understanding of the world in which they find themselves. Players learn of warring factions, key artefacts, and are introduced to key drivers of the worlds drama. When Non-Playing Characters (NPC) are introduced into the game, the dungeon master draws on this history to form quests and to feed the players a view of this world. These behavioural systems, however, react to a player’s moves with little consideration for the world context. This lack of context leads to the trope of the robotic NPC with little awareness of the world. How do we ingrain this knowledge of a contextual world? © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Dynamic storytelling generation; Human-centred artifical intelligence; Model-based design of interactive systems","Signal encoding; Behavioural systems; Multi planar; Non-playing characters; Role-playing game; Warring factions; Human computer interaction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Champandard, A.J.: AI Game development: synthetic creatures with learning and reactive behaviors. new riders (2003).

However, security analytics and security information, and event manager are devices, that can gather data about the historical behavior of attacks and correlate it to one another. The significance of this research is to precisely predict if an attack were about to happen, many industries only act if an attack was already happening inside their network or has done significant damages already to the business. This research would significantly help industries, to gain insights on the security events on their network. Artificial Intelligence can instantly predict and suggest if a person can potentially harm based on people's record of good behavior. This can be related to a computer’s normal pattern of behavior in the network and once an anomaly happens an unusual behavior can be detected. Hence, the best application of Artificial Intelligence in Cyber Security is to put out a fire before it spread out, preventing data breaches that can cause damages to people's lives and material assets. © IEOM Society International.","Artifical intelligence; Cybersecurity; Data breaches; Network access control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rego, Albert, Garcia, Laura, Sendra, Sandra, Lloret a, Jaime, (2018) Software Defined Network-based control system for an efficient traffic management for emergency situations in smart cities, Spain, , Https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X17330364, a, a,b Retrieve from; Mahn, Amy, (2014) Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover: The NIST Cybersecurity Framework, USA, , Https://www.nist.gov/blogs/taking-measure/identify-protect-detect-respond-and-recover-nist-cybersecurity-framework, Retrieve from; Panimalar, Arockia, Pai, Giri, Khan, Salman, (2018) Artificial Intelligence techniques for Cyber Security,India, , Https://www.academia.edu/36827589/ARTIFICIAL_INTELLIGENCE_TECHNIQUES_FOR_CYBER_SECUSECU, March Retrieved from; Bradbury, Danny, (2014) Unveiling the dark web, Canada, , Https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S135348581470042X, Retrieve from; (2019) The role of A.I. in Cyber-security, , Https://blog.eccouncil.org/the-role-of-ai-in-cybersecurity/, EC-Council, Dec Retrieved from website; Saini, Hemraj, Rao, Yerra Shankar, Panda, T.C., (2012) Cyber-Crimes and their Impacts India, , Https://www.researchgate.net/publication/241689554_Cyber-Crimes_and_their_Impacts_A_Review, April, Retrieve from; (2018) IT Asset Valuation, Risk Assessment and Control Implementation Model, , Https://www.isaca.org/resources/isaca-journal/issues/2017/volume-3/it-asset-valuation-risk-assessment-and-control-implementation-model, ISACA, May Retrieved from website; Kehrli, Jerome, (2017) Deciphering the Bangladesh bank heist, , Https://www.niceideas.ch/roller2/badtrash/entry/deciphering-the-bengladesh-bank-heist, November 15, Switzerland, Retrieved from; Moayad, Aloqaily a., Safa, Otoum b., Ismaeel Al Ridhawi, b., Jararweh, Yaser, (2019) An intrusion detection system for connected vehicles in smart cities, , https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570870519301131, UAE/CANADA/JORDAN.

Although smart city AI applications bring benefits of automation and efficiency, they also raise regulatory challenges, with concerns about discrimination in service provision, privacy, legal, and ethical issues. To address these issues, we propose an integrated and systematic framework for smart city AI regulation. To develop the framework, we first identify the dimensions of a smart city and the components of AI-enabled systems. We then discuss examples of smart city AI applications and the regulatory challenges they pose. Last, we describe our integrated framework of principles for smart city AI regulation, which addresses these challenges. Our study contributes to both the literatures on smart cities and AI frameworks, as well as practice on smart city AI policy and regulation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Artifical intelligence regulation; Artificial intelligence policy; Smart city artificial intelligence regulation; Smart principles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Accenture.

Those systems incorporate powerful machine learning algorithms, which are able to learn from, e.g., observations, play-traces, or by reinforcement learning. While many black box systems, such as deep neural networks, are able to achieve high performance in a wide range of applications, they generally lack interpretability. Additionally, previous systems often focused on a single or a small set of games, which makes it a cumbersome task to rebuild and retrain the agent for each possible application. This paper proposes a method, which extracts an interpretable set of game rules for previously unknown games. Frequent pattern mining is used to find common observation patterns in the game environment. Finally, game rules as well as winning-/losing-conditions are extracted via association rule analysis. Our evaluation shows that a wide range of game rules can be successfully extracted from previously unknown games. We further highlight how the application of fuzzy methods can advance our efforts in generating explainable artifical intelligence (AI) agents. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borgelt, C., Frequent item set mining (2012) Wiley Interdisc.

High-end methods in the present era of big data and artifical intelligence are designed to efficiently find patterns in large scale image data. The amount of data is today often too big to be parsed by human experts, and computer-assisted methods often perform at least as well as human experts on well-defined problems where it is possible to quantify performance by a loss function. This paper gives an overview of a computer-assisted method, Imiomics. Imiomics enables statistical analyses of relations between whole body image image data in large cohorts and other non-imaging data, at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Its usefulness in medicine is illustrated by a number of medical applications, and some aspects of technical development that enable the analysis is also presented. We conclude that computer-assisted methods, such as Imiomics, are essential for efficient processing of the huge amount of data in today's medical research and, to some extent, clinical practice. © 2020 Owner/Author.","image processing; large scale analysis; whole body imaging","Clinical research; Engineering research; Formal languages; Image analysis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical applications; Artifical intelligence; Clinical practices; Computer aided tools; Computer-assisted methods; Disease understanding; Spatial resolution; Sustainable work; Technical development; Medical imaging",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alberti, K., HEckel, R., MGrundy, S., Zimmet, P.Z., Cleeman, J.I., Donato, K.A., Fruchart, J.-C., Smith, S.C., Jr., Harmonizing the metabolic syndrome: A joint interim statement of the international diabetes federation task force on epidemiology and prevention; National heart, lung, and blood institute; American heart association; World heart federation; International atherosclerosis society; and international association for the study of obesity (2009) Circulation, 120 (16), pp. 1640-1645. , 2009; Berglund, J., Johansson, L., Ahlström, H., Kullberg, J., Three-point dixon method enables whole-body water and fat imaging of obese subjects.

Hence the use of an e-diary to capture triggers could be useful for both the patient and treating clinician. Virtual reality (VR) is not new to health sciences. This paper proposes a strategy that by using immersive VR environments at home, the technology could facilitate the user to identify baseline symptoms and record in an in-built virtual-reality based contextual diary (e-diary), plus an ability to alter the virtual environments to assess triggers, habituation of triggers and also treatment improvements.

A rise in robotic labour may either have positive or negative effects on wages by means of a traditional mechanism involving labour, robots and common resources. Alternatively, the aggregate output relationship can be calculated directly by using Houthakker's 1950s method without measuring capital or other fixed variables. The method of Houthakker is based on the probability distribution of the variable factor productivity. The various distributions on the US productivity are indicated for cross-sectional results. The growth of AI technologies will cause salaries to decrease, other things equal to, if the Elasticity of Replacement between Human and ROBOTIC labour is higher than about 1.9. For the processing industry, even less human-robot replacement elasticity is likely to result in lower industrial workers ' salaries as robots proliferate. © 2020 Alpha Publishers.

They already support medical staff by mapping their workflows with shared availability of cases’ referral information, as needed for example, by the pathologist, and this support will be increased in the future even more. In radiology, established standards define information models, data transmission mechanisms, and workflows. Other disciplines, such as pathology, cardiology, and radiation therapy, now define further demands in addition to these established standards. Pathology may have the highest technical demands on the systems, with very complex workflows, and the digitization of slides generating enormous amounts of data up to Gigabytes per biopsy. This requires enormous amounts of data to be generated per biopsy, up to the gigabyte range.

It assesses whether there is a difference in the perceptions of risk and trust in artificial intelligence expressed by the general public compared with those studying computer science in higher education. We define the general public as people having no specific level or specialist knowledge of AI yet with a high stake as potential users of AI systems on a regular basis with or without their knowledge. In the study, participants engaged in an AI debate on topical news articles at a public national science museum event and a University in the UK and completed a questionnaire with two sections: their assessment of trust and risk of an AI application based on a topical news story, and a set of general opinion questions on AI. Results indicate that in specific applications there is a significant difference of opinion between the two groups with regards to risk. Both groups strongly agreed that education in how AI works was significant in building trust. © 2020 IEEE.","perception; risk; trust","Behavioral research; Education computing; Neural networks; Risk assessment; AI applications; Artifical intelligence; General publics; Higher education; Perceived risk; Perceptions of risks; Potential users; Science museum; Risk perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cambridge English Dictionary, , https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/trust, [online], [Accessed 6 Dec. 2019]; Loi, F.A., Viganò, E.M., (2019) Ai We Trust Incrementally: A Multi-layer Model of Trust to Analyze Human-Artificial Intelligence Interactions, Philosophy & Technology, , https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-019-00378-3; (2019) Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Ai, , https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/ethics-guidelinestrustworthy-Ai, [online], [Accessed 6 Dec. 2019]; Siau, K., Wang, W., Building trust in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics (2018) Cutter Business Technology Journal, (31), pp. 47-53; Javanmardian, C.B., Samandari, H.K., (2019) Confronting the Risks Of Artificial Intelligence, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/mckinseyanalytics/our-insights/confronting-The-risks-of-Artificial-intelligence#, McKinsey, [online]; (2019) Share of Adults Who Trust News Media Most of the Time in Selected Countries Worldwide As of February 2019, , https://www.statista.com/statistics/308468/importance-brandjournalist-creating-Trust-news/, [online]; Mcdonald, A., (2019) Improve Public Understanding of AI, or Risk Spread of Fake News Report Warns, , https://www.bhf.org.uk/what-we-do/news-from-The-bhf/newsarchive/2019/may/improve-public-understanding-of-Ai-or-riskspread-of-fake-news-report-warns, [online]; Yanushkevich, S., Howells, G., Crockett, K., O'Shea, J., Oliveira, H.C.R., Guest, R., Shmerko, V., Cognitive identity management: Risks, trust and decisions using heterogeneous sources (2019) Proceedings of the First Ieee International Conference on Cognitive Machine Intelligence.

Model-free control methods perform more effcient than traditional model-based control method for complex nonlinear system since they don't require accurate models. In this study, by using the Dueling-Double-DQN (Dueling-DDQN, 3-DQN) algorithm, a self-learning controller is developed for the magnetic levitation ball system. The numerical simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of our controller. Moreover, we compare the above controller with the DQN-based self-learning controller. Numerical simulation shows that the attraction domain of the Dueling-DDQN controller is larger that the latter. © 2020 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Dueling-Double-DQN; Magnetic levitation ball system; Model-free control; Reinforcement learning","Deep learning; Learning systems; Magnetic levitation; Numerical models; Reinforcement learning; Artifical intelligence; Attraction domain; Complex nonlinear system; Model free control method; Reinforcement learning techniques; Self-learning; Traditional models; Controllers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rohacs, J., Rohacs, D., The potential application method of magnetic levitation technology-as a ground-based power-to assist the aircraft takeoff and landing processes (2014) Aircraft Engineering and Aerospace Technology, 86 (3), pp. 188-197. , apr; Zhou, Y., Kou, B., Liu, P., Zhang, H., Xing, F., Yang, X., Force characteristic analysis of amagnetic gravity compensator with annular magnet array for magnetic levitation positioning system (2018) AIP Advances, 8 (5), p. 056706. , may; Jiang, C., Ueno, S., Development of magnetic levitation device for active vibration control (2016) 2016 International Conference on Advanced Mechatronic Systems (ICAMechS, pp. 85-89. , IEEE, nov; Chopade, A.S., Khubalkar, S.W., Junghare, A.S., Aware, M.V., Das, S., Design and implementation of digital fractional order pid controller using optimal pole-zero approximation method for magnetic levitation system (2018) IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica, 5 (5), pp. 977-989. , sep; Bojan-Dragos, C.A., Precup, R.E., Preitl, S., Hergane, S., Hughiet, E.G., Szedlak-Stinean, A.I., Proportional-integral gainscheduling control of a magnetic levitation system (2016) 2016 20th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing, ICSTCC 2016-Joint Conference of SINTES 20, SACCS 16, SIMSIS 20-Proceedings, 1, pp. 1-6; Baig, J.I., Mahmood, A., Robust control design of a magnetic levitation system (2017) Proceedings of the 2016 19th International Multi-Topic Conference, INMIC 2016, pp. 1-5; Hedrea, L.E., Bojan-Dragos, C.A., Precup, R.E., Roman, R.C., Petriu, E.M., Hedrea, C., Tensor product-based model transformation for position control of magnetic levitation systems (2017) IEEE International Symposium on Industrial Electronics, pp. 1141-1146; Levine, S., (2018) Reinforcement Learning and Control as Probabilistic Inference: Tutorial and Review, , may; Chohra, A., Madani, K., (2017) Adaptive Motivation System Under Modular Reinforcement Learning for Agent Decision-Making Modeling of Biological Regulation, pp. 32-42; Kroeger, T., Sensor-based control, real-time motion planning, and reinforcement learning for industrial robots (2017) 2017 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII, p. 3. , IEEE, dec; Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Rusu, A.A., Veness, J., Bellemare, M.G., Graves, A., Hassabis, D., Humanlevel control through deep reinforcement learning (2015) Nature, 518 (7540), pp. 529-533; Silver, D., Huang, A., Maddison, C.J., Guez, A., Sifre, L., Van Den Driessche, G., Schrittwieser, J., Hassabis, D., Mastering the game of go with deep neural networks and tree search (2016) Nature, 529 (7587), pp. 484-489. , jan; Huang, T., Liang, Y., Ban, X., Zhang, J., Huang, X., The control of magnetic levitation system based on improved q-network (2019) 2019 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI, pp. 190-196. , Xiamen, China; Lopez-Martinez, D., Eschenfeldt, P., Ostvar, S., Ingram, M., Hur, C., Picard, R., (2019) Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Critical Care Pain Management with Morphine using Dueling Double-Deep Q Networks, , apr; Chiang, H.K., Tseng, W.T., Fang, C.C., Chen, C.A., Integral backstepping sliding mode control of a magnetic ball suspension system (2013) Proceedings of the International Conference on Power Electronics and Drive Systems, pp. 44-49; Van Hasselt, H., Guez, A., Silver, D., Deep reinforcement learning with double q-learning (2016) 30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AAAI, 2016, pp. 2094-2100; Wang, Z., Schaul, T., Hessel, M., Van Hasselt, H., Lanctot, M., De Frcitas, N., Dueling network architectures for deep reinforcement learning (2016) 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2016, 4 (9), pp. 2939-2947","Systems Engineering Society of China (SESC);Technical Committee on Control Theory (TCCT) of Chinese Association of Automation (CAA)","39th Chinese Control Conference, CCC 2020","27 July 2020 through 29 July 2020",,162927,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091396887

They represent an elegant way to decipher chemically encoded ligand information and have therefore become a valuable tool in drug design. In this review, we provide an overview on the basic concept of this method and summarize key studies for applying 3D pharmacophore models in virtual screening and mechanistic studies for protein functionality. Moreover, we discuss recent developments in the field. The combination of 3D pharmacophore models with molecular dynamics simulations could be a quantum leap forward since these approaches consider macromolecule–ligand interactions as dynamic and therefore show a physiologically relevant interaction pattern. Other trends include the efficient usage of 3D pharmacophore information in machine learning and artificial intelligence applications or freely accessible web servers for 3D pharmacophore modeling. The recent developments show that 3D pharmacophore modeling is a vibrant field with various applications in drug discovery and beyond.

Unfortunately, these studies have been done by experts of different fields and are yet to be combined in a common platform to predict the states of batteries in a comprehensive way. In this paper, the aim of this research is to propose a framework so as to establish a big database (from sources of literature, by performing real-time experiments and uncertainty studies) for batteries at all operating conditions by incorporating all aforesaid aspects. Once the data base is established, a suitable artifical intelligence approach such as artificial neural network will be applied to train and build the model for state of health prediction and physical evaluation that subsequently have the prime advantage of accurately predicting the battery capacity at system level as well as cell level based on all existing design parameters (diffusion coefficient, grain size, temperature, internal resistance, etc.) from the big database. Data collection will be processed on brand new batteries by repeating cycles of charge and discharge modes under dynamic current profiles at different temperatures for accuracy. The proposed battery model can be then integrated to the battery management system in the electric vehicle without any additional integration complexity. © 2020 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In particular these platforms, along with the use of artifical intelligence algorithms, can be exploited to detect and monitor people’s activities, in particular potentially harmful situations, such as falling. However, wearable devices have limited computational power and battery life. We optimize a situation-recognition application via the well-known precision tuning practice using a dedicated state-of-the-art toolchain. After the optimization we evaluate how the reduced-precision version better fits the use case of limited-resources platforms, such as wearable devices. In particular, we achieve over 500% of speedup in execution time, and consume about 6 times less energy to carry out the classification. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

At the same time, controlling the population density and population movement in densely populated areas plays an important role in ensuring national security for the public security departments. Therefore, how to properly adjust the switching time of traffic signals has become an urgent problem. In view of the above requirements, this paper proposes a signal switching model based on deep learning for dynamic regulation of pedestrian traffic. The hybrid model is divided into three parts, named the real-time data acquisition part, the historical data analysis and prediction part and the decision model part. Firstly, the LSTM model is used for the analysis and prediction of historical traffic data with time series characteristics. Then, the real-time data acquisition adopts the lightweight and high-performance target detection model MobileNet-SSD proposed by Google.

In 2017, two equally passionate members, a gifted engineer, Rahul Nayak, and an educator, Iti Mathur, joined their team. Samagra’s original business model focused on building and maintaining toilets for the urban poor. However, by 2017, having gone through multiple business model iterations, they had revised their business to use state-of-the-art technology and reduce the operating expenses of school, public, and community toilets in urban slums of Pune. By 2017, Samagra had developed memorandums of understandings (MOUs) with 6 municipalities across the country to build and maintain public and community toilets. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG, part of Springer Nature 2020.","Artifical Intelligence; Institutional rational choice theory; Internet of Things; Multi-stakeholder ownership and accountability; Sanitation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Swachh bharat mission-gramin (All india) (2019) Retrieved from Swachh Bharat Mission:, , https://sbm.gov.in/sbmReport/home.aspx, Swachh Bharat Mission, April 23; Banda, K., Sarkar, R., Gopal, S., Govindarajan, J., Harijan, B.B., Jeyakumar, M.B., Water handling, sanitation, and defecation practices in rural southern india: A knowledge, attitudes, and practices study (2007) Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, 101 (11), p. 1124; Teltumbde, A., No swachh bharat without annihilation of caste (2014) Economic and Political Weekly, pp. 11-12. , November; Biswas, D., Jamwal, P., Swachh bharat mission: Groundwater contamination (2017) Economic and Political Weekly, 52 (20), pp. 18-20; McFarlane, C., Governing the contaminated city: Infrastructure and sanitation in colonial and post-colonial bombay (2008) International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 32 (2), pp. 415-435; Ambesh, P., Ambesh, S.P., Open defecation in india: A major health hazard and hurdle in infection control (2016) Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research: JCDR, 10 (7); (2017) Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines; Elledge, M.F., McClatchey, M., India, urban sanitation, and the toilet challenge (2013) RTI Research Brief; Bathija, G., Sarvar, R., Defecation practices in residents of urban slums and rural areas of hubballi, dharwad: A cross sectional study (2017) International Journal of Community Medicine and Public Health, 4, p. 724. , http://doi.org/10.18203/2394-6040.ijcmph20170747; Kumar Karn, S., Harada, H., Field survey on water supply, sanitation and associated health impacts in urban poor communities-a case from mumbai city, india (2002) Water Science and Technology, 46 (11-12), pp. 269-275; Chaplin, S.E., Indian cities, sanitation and the state: The politics of the failure to provide (2011) Environment and Urbanization, 23 (1), p. 57; Hueso, A., Bell, B., An untold story of policy failure: The total sanitation campaign in india (2013) Water Policy, 15 (6), pp. 1001-1017; Hueso, A., Bell, B., An untold story of policy failure: The total sanitation campaign in india (2013) Water Policy, 15 (6), pp. 1001-1017; Ramani, S.V., SadreGhazi, S., Duysters, G., On the diffusion of toilets as bottom of the pyramid innovation: Lessons from sanitation entrepreneurs (2012) Technological Forecasting and Social Change, 79 (4), pp. 676-687; Chaplin, S.E., Cities, sewers and poverty: India’s politics of sanitation (1999) Environment and Urbanization, 11 (1), pp. 145-158; Fam, D., Lopes, A., Willetts, J., Mitchell, C., The challenge of system change: An historical analysis of sydney’s sewer systems (2009) Design Philosophy Papers, 7 (3), pp. 195-208; Geels, F.W., The hygienic transition from cesspools to sewer systems (1840-1930): The dynamics of regime transformation (2006) Research Policy, 35 (7), pp. 1069-1082; Stanwell-Smith, R., The infection potential in the home and the role of hygiene: Historical and current perspectives (2003) International Journal of Environmental Health Research, 13, pp. SS9-S17; Tomes, N., The private side of public health: Sanitary science, domestic hygiene, and the germtheory, 1870-1900 (1990) Bulletin of the History of Medicine, 64 (4), pp. 509-539; Ghosh, A., Cairncross, S., The uneven progress of sanitation in india (2014) Journal of Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for Development, 4 (1), pp. 15-22; Dossal, M., Henry conybeare and the politics of centralised water supply in midnineteenth century bombay (1988) The Indian Economic &, 25 (1), pp. 79-96; Leith, A., (1864) Report on the Sanitary State of the Island of Bombay, , Bombay: Education Society Press; Farooqui, A., Urban development in a colonial situation: Early nineteenth century bombay (1996) Economic and Political Weekly, pp. 2746-2759; Doshi, S., Imperial water, urban crisis: A political ecology of colonial state formation in bombay, 1850-1890 (2014) Review (Fernand Braudel Center), 37 (3-4), pp. 173-218; Subramanian, L., Indigenous capital and imperial expansion (1996) Bombay, Surat and the West Coast, New Delhi, pp. 27-28; Melosi, M.V., (2008) The Sanitary City: Environmental Services in Urban America from Colonial Times to the Present, , University of Pittsburgh Press; Tagat, A., Kapoor, H., Sacred nudging” and sanitation decisions in india (2018) India Review, 17 (3), pp. 301-319; Deshpande, A., Does caste still define disparity?

Following imagery capture and processing, deficiencies are identified, and targeted mitigation strategies are executed at greatly reduced cycle time and cost. Methods, Procedures, Process: A pre-mobilization facility scan plan is generated to maximize imagery quality, including high elevation scan positions, to ensure thorough and comprehensive analytics. Data from all scan positions are stitched together in a point cloud and aligned for accuracy relative to each location. Finalized imagery and point clouds are then tagged with unique piping line numbers per design, fixed equipment tags, or unique asset identification. The Machine Learning algorithm is intensely trained with manual ground truth inputs prior to analysis. The algorithm analyzes each pixel throughout the facility and detects, classifies, and reports on all identified corrosion, tagging faults to specific piping or equipment. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Atmospheric corrosion is the number one Asset Integrity threat in the Gulf of Mexico. Utilizing this tool, we can have a comprehensive and objective analysis of a facility's health in a matter of weeks from the time of data collection. Data collection for a large deep-water, spar facility requires approximately 12 days with 8 data scanning personnel. Conventional manual inspections incur higher risk, higher cost, and reporting is much less objective considering the number of inspectors involved and the duration of a full-facility campaign. Finally, all results are published in a user-friendly dashboard that can be filtered by process type, equipment type, corrosion severity, and many other criteria as the user requires. Each fault is associated with the specific equipment identification and the user can navigate to see the imagery of the corrosion in a 3D, photogrammetric environment. Remediation strategies can be collated into work packs for fabric maintenance teams, further Nondestructive Examination (NDE) assessment, or work orders for replacement. Fabric maintenance efficiencies are substantially realized by targeting decks, blocks, or areas with the highest aggregate surface areas of corrosion (on process equipment or structurally, as selected by the user) and concentrating remediation efforts on at-risk equipment. Novel/Additive Information: This application of Artifical Intelligence and Machine Learning is a first-in-industry approach to having a comprehensive understanding of facility coating integrity and external corrosion threats. HSE analysis, Risk awareness, and targeted remediation strategies will make the Asset Integrity program more efficient, proactive, and reduce down-time across the Gulf of Mexico related to atmospheric corrosion. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Atmospheric corrosion; Corrosive effects; Data acquisition; Efficiency; Gasoline; Machine learning; Maintenance; Nondestructive examination; Pollution; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Seawater corrosion; Artifical intelligence; Asset identification; Corrosion severity; Maintenance efficiency; Mitigation strategy; Objective analysis; Process equipments; Remediation strategies; Learning algorithms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ortiz, Alberto, Bonnin-Pascual, Francisco, Garcia-Fidalgo, Emilio, Company, Joan P., Visual inspection of vessels by means of a micro-aerial vehicle: an artificial neural network approach for corrosion detection (2016) Robot 2015: Second Iberian Robotics Conference, pp. 223-234. , Springer; Petricca, Luca, Moss, Tomas, Figueroa, Gonzalo, Broen, Stian, Corrosion detection using ai: a comparison of standard computer vision techniques and deep learning model (2016) Proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on Computer Science, Engineering and Information Technology, 91, p. 99; Hoang, Nhat-Duc, Tran, Van-Duc, Image processing-based detection of pipe corrosion using texture analysis and metaheuristic-optimized machine learning approach (2019) Computational intelligence and neuroscience, p. 2019; Nash, Will T, Powell, CJ, Drummond, Tom, Birbilis, Nick, Automated corrosion detection using crowdsourced training for deep learning (2020) Corrosion, 76 (2), pp. 135-141; Nash, Will, Drummond, Tom, Birbilis, Nick, Deep learning AI for corrosion detection (2019) Corrosion 2019, , NACE International; Garcia-Garcia, Alberto, Orts-Escolano, Sergio, Oprea, Sergiu, Villena-Martinez, Victor, Garcia-Rodriguez, Jose, (2017) A review on deep learning techniques applied to semantic segmentation, , arXiv preprint arXiv:1704.06857; Liu, Xiaolong, Deng, Zhidong, Yang, Yuhan, Recent progress in semantic image segmentation (2019) Artificial Intelligence Review, 52 (2), pp. 1089-1106; Fröhlich Gmb, H., Z+f imager 5016, 3D laser scanner, , www.zf-laser.com/Z-FIMAGER-R-5016.184.0.html, Zoller & accessed 04 August 2020",,"Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2020, ADIP 2020","9 November 2020 through 12 November 2020",,165204,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097562399

Along with the increasing amount of data generated through online activities by customers, various hospitality companies have been investing in AI-powered solutions to be able to have better understanding about their customers and provide the relevant service to them accordingly. Despite knowing the impact on the customer service orientation, little is known about the impact of AI on the business process of a hospitality company. This paper explores the impact of the adoption of the AI on the business process of a hospitality company to have a better understanding of the extent of particular part of the business process that would benefit from the adoption of AI. It is apparent that Revenue Management and Marketing are the parts of business process within the hospitality industry that would have more positive impact on the adoption of AI. While AI-based marketing would be able to identify and target effectively high-value consumers, revenue management would be able to determine the right pricing strategy in real time due to the vast amount of available data and subsequently would have positive impact on the financial performance of the hospitality company. © 2021 Emerald Publishing Limited.","Artifical intelligence; Business process; IHG; Revenue management; Technology adoption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bughin, J., Hazan, E., Ramaswamy, S., Chui, M., Allas, T., Dahlstrom, P., Trench, ….M., (2017) Artificial Intelligence: the Next Digital Frontier?, , https://www.mckinsey.com/;/media/mckinsey/industries/advanced%20electronics/our%20insights/how%20artificial%20intelligence%20can%20deliver%20real%20value%20to%20companies/mgi-artificial-intelligence-discussion-paper.ashx, McKinsey Global Institute.

XiaoIce is uniquely designed as an artifical intelligence companion with an emotional connection to satisfy the human need for communication, affection, and social belonging. We take into account both intelligent quotient and emotional quotient in system design, cast human– machine social chat as decision-making over Markov Decision Processes, and optimize XiaoIce for long-term user engagement, measured in expected Conversation-turns Per Session (CPS). We detail the system architecture and key components, including dialogue manager, core chat, skills, and an empathetic computing module. We show how XiaoIce dynamically recognizes human feelings and states, understands user intent, and responds to user needs throughout long conversations. Since the release in 2014, XiaoIce has communicated with over 660 million active users and succeeded in establishing long-term relationships with many of them. Analysis of large-scale online logs shows that XiaoIce has achieved an average CPS of 23, which is significantly higher than that of other chatbots and even human conversations. © 2020 Association for Computational Linguistics.",,"Decision making; Markov processes; Artifical intelligence; Design and implementations; Dialogue manager; Emotional connections; Intelligent quotient; Long-term relationships; Markov Decision Processes; System architectures; Behavioral research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albrecht, J., Hwa, R., A re-examination of machine learning approaches for sentence-level MT evaluation (2007) Proceedings of the 45Th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 880-887. , pages, Prague; Anderson, P., Fernando, B., Johnson, M., Gould, S., Spice: Semantic propositional image caption evaluation (2016) European Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 382-398; Anderson, P., He, X., Buehler, C., Teney, D., Johnson, M., Gould, S., Zhang, L., Bottom-up and top-down attention for image captioning and visual question answering (2018) Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, pp. 6077-6086; Asimov, I., (1984) The Bicentennial Man in I, , Asimov, The Bicentennial Man and Other Stories; Banerjee, S., Lavie, A., Meteor: An automatic metric for MT evaluation with improved correlation with human judgments (2005) Proceedings of the ACL Workshop on Intrinsic and Extrinsic Evaluation Measures for Machine Translation And/Or Summarization, pp. 65-72. , pages; Brahnam, S., (2005) Strategies for Handling Customer Abuse of ECAS.

Methods: Diagnostic study. From January 2016 to January 2019, who admitted to Tianjin Eye Hospital from 18 to 48 years old, with an average of (28.4±8.2) years of myopia patients in 2 018 cases. Two experienced ophthalmologists labeled keratoconus, subclinical keratconus and nomal cornea based on the topography. The data of 80% (1 615 cases) patients were randomly selected as the training set by computer random sampling method, and the data of 20% (403 cases) patients were used as the verification set. Using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm to extract 28 corneal parameters, and establish an algorithm model to diagnose the corneal condition of the patient, verify the diagnostic accuracy of the model by using the 10-fold cross-validation method, and evaluate the model using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Sensitivity and specificity with the original labeling and ophthalmic resident labeling. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of the model was 95.53%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the validation set was 0.996 6. The accuracy of the model for diagnosis of subclinical keratoconus and normal cornea was 96.67%, the AUC of the validation set was 0.993 6; the accuracy of diagnosis of keratoconus and normal cornea was 98.91%, and the AUC of the validation set was 0.998 2. The diagnostic accuracy of the model is 95.53%, which is significantly better than the resident's 93.55%. Conclusion: The model established by artifical intelligence can diagnose the subclinical keratoconus with high accuracy, which can greatly improve the clinical diagnosis efficiency and accuracy of young and primary ophthalmologists.

Though AI assists in making these tasks more efficient, and seemingly less biased through automation, it relies heavily on data created by humans, and consequently can have human biases carry over to decisions made by a model. Several studies have shown biases in machine learning applications such as facial recognition and candidate ranking. This has spurred active research on the topic of fairness in machine learning over the last five years. Several toolkits to mitigate biases and interpret black box models have been developed in an effort to promote fair algorithms. This paper presents an overview of fairness definitions, methods, and tools as they relate to recruitment and establishes ethical considerations in the use of machine learning in the hiring space. © 2019 IEEE.","artifical intelligence; bias; discrimination; ethical recruitment; fairness; hiring","Face recognition; Machine learning; Personnel; Artifical intelligence; bias; discrimination; ethical recruitment; fairness; hiring; Philosophical aspects",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: 1936857","ACKNOWLEDGMENT This material is based upon work supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1936857.","National Science Foundation under Grant No. 1936857.",,,,,,,,,"Jobs Lost, Jobs Gained: Workforce Transitions in A Time of Automation, , McKinsey Global Institute McKinsey & Company 2017; Biswas, S., The Beginners Guide to AI in HR, , https://www.hrtechnologist.com/articles/digital-Transformation/thebeginners-guide-To-Ai-in-hr/, HR Technologist, 5 February 2019.

While AI spans a range of methods that enable machines to learn from data and operate autonomously, CI serves as a means to this end by finding its niche in algorithms that are inspired by complex natural phenomena (including the working of the brain). In this paper, we demarcate the key issues surrounding these fields using five unique Rs, namely, rationalizability, resilience, reproducibility, realism, and responsibility. Notably, just as air serves as the basic element of biological life, the term AIR5 - cumulatively referring to the five aforementioned Rs - is introduced herein to mark some of the basic elements of artificial life, for sustainable AI and CI. A brief summary of each of the Rs is presented, highlighting their relevance as pillars of future research in this arena. © 2017 IEEE.","Artifical intelligence; rationalizability; realism; reproducibility; resilience; responsibility","Artificial intelligence; Computational methods; Artifical intelligence; rationalizability; realism; Reproducibilities; resilience; responsibility; Artificial life",,,,,"Nanyang Technological University, NTU","This work was supported in part by the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research Centre of the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, and in part by the SIMTech-NTU Joint Lab on Complex Systems.",,,,,,,,,,"Schmidhuber, J., Deep learning in neural networks: An overview (2015) Neural Netw., 61, pp. 85-117; LeCun, Y., Bengio, Y., Hinton, G., Deep learning (2015) Nature, 521 (7553), pp. 436-444; Stanley, K.O., Clune, J., Lehman, J., Miikkulainen, R., Designing neural networks through neuroevolution (2019) Nature Mach.

Periodontal diseaseis an inflammatory disease of tissues that hold the teeth wherein, there is gradual destruction of tissues and subsequent loss of teeth. These two are interrelated and here, prediction is to prevent the disease occurrence in advance before it arise and create treatment strategies for future prevention of the disease.Prediction of cardiac arrest from periodontal dental disease is done using Artificial intelligence in cloud. Artificial intelligence is the “study and design of intelligent agents” where an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its surroundings and adapts to make the best probable action to Maximise the probability of success.This paper highlights latest studies regarding implemented techniques such as diagnosis of Periodontal Dental Disease for all age group people, smokers and drunken people, risk assessment of periodontal dental disease for all age group people, heart disease prediction system, and heart rate monitoring using emotional intelligence. © BEIESP.","Artifical intelligence;

Objective: Summary of the current knowledge and major challenges for molecular targeted and cell-based cancer therapies. Material and methods: Evaluation of PubMed-listed publications and reports from scientific meetings in the past 25 years in the field of molecular and cell-based cancer treatment, including expected progress and developments. Results: The indications for molecular targeted and cell-based therapies are increasing. Especially in solid tumors, heterogeneity and evolution limit the efficacy of molecular targeted therapies. The identification of tumor-associated antigens and how to overcome the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment are major challenges for the development of cell-based therapies. Promising strategies include genetically modified T‑cells, NK cells, mesenchymal stroma cells, dendritic cells, technologies of in vivo targeting and individualized RNA vaccines. Comprehensive characterization of tumors on the genomic, transcriptomic, epigenetic and proteomic levels is needed for development of more effective personalized treatment. Artifical intelligence is required for processing and interpretation of big data, for making the diagnosis and medical decision-making. Conclusion: The biological complexity necessitates multimodal concepts and a more comprehensive molecular characterization of tumors. This includes the use of artificial intelligence to avoid ineffective treatment, to overcome potential resistance mechanisms against molecular targeted and cell-based therapies and to achieve a definitive elimination or long-term control of individual tumor diseases. © 2019, Springer Medizin Verlag GmbH, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","CAR-T cells; Cell therapy; Molecular target; Tumor heterogeneity; Vaccine","cancer vaccine; RNA vaccine; tumor antigen; artificial intelligence; big data; cancer diagnosis; cancer immunotherapy; cell therapy; chimeric antigen receptor T-cell immunotherapy; dendritic cell; drug indication; drug targeting; epigenetics; genomics; in vivo study; medical decision making; mesenchymal stroma cell; molecularly targeted therapy; natural killer cell; proteomics; Review; solid malignant neoplasm; T lymphocyte; transcriptomics; tumor microenvironment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abken, H., Driving CARs on the highway to solid cancer: some considerations on the adoptive therapy with CAR T cells (2017) Hum Gene Ther, 28, pp. 1047-1060; Aparicio, S., Caldas, C., The implications of clonal genome evolution for cancer medicine (2013) N Engl J Med, 368, pp. 842-851; Binder, H., Big Data und Deep Learning in der Onkologie (2018) Onkologe, 24, pp. 361-367; Boll, K., Reiche, K., Kasack, K., MiR-130a, miR-203 and miR-205 jointly repress key oncogenic pathways and are downregulated in prostate carcinoma (2013) Oncogene, 32, pp. 277-285; Borgaonkar, D.S., Philadelphia-chromosome translocation and chronic myeloid leukaemia (1973) Lancet, 1, p. 1250; Bortin, M.M., Bach, F.H., van Bekkum, D.W., 25th anniversary of the first successful allogeneic bone marrow transplants (1994) Bone Marrow Transplant., 14, pp. 211-212; Brown, C.E., Alizadeh, D., Starr, R., Regression of glioblastoma after chimeric antigen receptor T‑cell therapy (2016) N Engl J Med, 375, pp. 2561-2569; Büning, H., Huber, A., Zhang, L., Engineering the AAV capsid to optimize vector-host-interactions (2015) Curr Opin Pharmacol, 24, pp. 94-104; Cataldo, V.D., Gibbons, D.L., Pérez-Soler, R., Quintás-Cardama, A., Treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer with erlotinib or gefitinib (2011) N Engl J Med, 364, pp. 947-955; Corcoran, R.B., Chabner, B.A., Application of cell-free DNA analysis to cancer treatment (2018) N Engl J Med, 379, pp. 1754-1765; Druker, B.J., Talpaz, M., Resta, D.J., Efficacy and safety of a specific inhibitor of the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase in chronic myeloid leukemia (2001) N Engl J Med, 344, pp. 1031-1037; Hackermüller, J., Reiche, K., Otto, C., Cell cycle, oncogenic and tumor suppressor pathways regulate numerous long and macro non-protein-coding RNAs (2014) Genome Biol, 15, p.

As this waste is a threat to the environment and it demands significant financial resources to be tackled. Though human being can think in multi-dimension., but to consider all the contributing attributes for waste management is beyond its limit. For this purpose., there has been always a need of a artificial intelligence (AI) which could help in directing towards the management of the produced waste. Generation of construction and demolition (CD) waste is unavoidable in any circumstance and handling this waste is always a menace to the managers. This requires high technicalities and a huge amount of resources to be spent on proper waste control. This paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for an effective construction waste management system (EMS) by application of artificial intelligence (AI), which could decide a suitable technique to be implemented on the produced waste. A comprehensive review of waste generation attributes, waste management techniques, and adaptability feasibility is carried out to identify loopholes and limitations of each technique. The proposed EMS will help the construction practitioners to apply the most suitable, most viable, most feasible and most economical waste management technique to control on-site construction and demolition waste, based on its own capacity and type of waste. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence (AI);

As deeply as the industrial revolution upended 20th century social norms and political structures, so too has modern information technology been a revolution, giving governments and large private corporations vast power to keep track of, manipulate, and potentially repress entire populations. China offers some examples in this area, but even democratically elected governments have shown a tendency to want to digitally profile and analyze their citizens without sufficient respect for individual privacy. And just as rampant industrialization had to be reined in to protect human rights and individual dignity, information technology and digital systems must be controlled to prevent abuse and exploitation.

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components-models may be 'entangled' in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations. © 2019 IEEE.","Artifical Intelligence; Data; Machine Learning; Process; Software Engineering","Computer software reusability; Engineering education; Learning systems; Machine components; Machine learning; Processing; Software engineering; Artifical intelligence; Data; Development process; Engineering challenges; Information technology sector; Machine learning applications; Software applications; Software engineering process; Application programs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Salvaris, M., Dean, D., Tok, W.H., Microsoft AI Platform (2018) Deep Learning with Azure, pp. 79-98. , Springer; Begel, A., Nagappan, N., Usage and perceptions of agile software development in an industrial context: An exploratory study First International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2007), pp. 255-264. , Sept 2007; Begel, A., Nagappan, N., Pair programming: What?s in it for me?

These agents are built considering the medical interventions required to improve the overall health of the society. The AI agent designed acts intelligently during the process of the interaction between the humans and itself. It allows the user to use the interface by asking interactive questions then it processes them and responds relatively. Conversational agents are not only web based but they can also be used on other platforms like mobile phone or any other mobile devices. Despite all these a user shall be satisfied if and only if the software is easy to use and obtains the exact results with all of the queries being answered. The main concern with this model is to give that ease to the user to interact with the agent thus solving the queries related to the symptoms suffered by the patients and hence predicting the disease at an early stage by maintaining the accuracy. There are around 100000 diseases in the world according to WHO. Most of their symptoms overlap as well hence by using this agent its possible by it to think insightfully and predict the early symptoms of the disease. In this paper we have designed a user interface and this interacts with the user to take the necessary inputs. This data is fed to the advanced Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to provide the personalized prediction based on the user interaction. The predictions done by the model uses the classification algorithms of Machine Learning. The accuracy of each of these algorithms varies. Therefore instead of considering only one algorithm and hoping it gives the best accuracy, we can use the Ensemble learning method to improve the overall prediction rate. This method gives better predictive indications as it combines many models results thereby improving the overall precision. Here we train our model using various algorithms and ensemble them to get the final results based on the technique of voting. This paper presents a front-end interface for common man using HTML and Angular JS, NLU for text pre-processing using Tensorflow method and ML model as a classifier, for the prediction which uses various machine learning algorithms like SVM, Decision Tree, Random forest etc and combines them all in a majority voting ensemble for balanced results. Therefore this model interacts with any patients be it from the rural or the urban and based on their symptoms predicts and ranks the most probable disease accurately and reliably. © BEIESP.","Artifical Intelligence; Conversational Agent; Decision Tree; Ensemble Learning; Random Forest; SVM; TensorFlow word embedding",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wang, H., Zhang, Q., Ip, M., Lau, J.T.F., Conversational Agents for Health Management and Interventions (2018) IEEE Computer Society; Laranjo, L., Dunn, A.G., Tong, H.L., Kocaballi, A.B., Chen, J., Bashir, R., Surian, D., Coiera, E., Conversational agents in healthcare: A systematic review (2018) Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association, 25 (9), pp. 1248-1258; Fayyazifar, N., Samadiani, N., Parkinson’s Disease Detection Using Ensemble Techniques and Genetic Algorithm (2017) Artificial Intelligence and Signal Processing (AISP), IEEE; Mahboob, T., Irfan, R., Ghaffar, B., Evaluating Ensemble Prediction of Coronary Heart Disease using Receiver Operating Characteristics (2017) IEEE Conference; Li, L., Chen, M., Wang, H., Chen, W., Guo, Z., A Cost Sensitive Ensemble Method for Medical Prediction (2009) First International Workshop on Database Technology and Applications IEEE Computer Society; Gupta, M., Gupta, B., An Ensemble Model for Breast Cancer Prediction Using Sequential Least Squares Programming Method (SLSQP) (2018) Proceedings of 2018 Eleventh International Conference on Contemporary Computing (IC3), , 2-4 August, Noida, India; Pan, Q., Zhang, Y., Zuo, M., Xiang, L., Chen, D., Improved Ensemble Classification Method of Thyroid Disease Based on Random Forest (2016) 8Th International Conference on Information Technology in Medicine and Education; Rahman, M.J.-U., Sultan, R.I., Mahmud, F., Shawon, A., Khan, A., Ensemble of Multiple Models For Robust Intelligent Heart Disease Prediction System (2018) 4Th International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Information & Communication Technology; Kanchan, D., Kishor, M.M., Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Special Disease Prediction using Principal of Component Analysis (2016) International Conference on Global Trends in Signal Processing, Information Computing and Communication; Dinesh Kumar, G., Arumugaraj, K., Santhosh Kumar, D., Mareeswari, V., Prediction of Cardiovascular Disease Using Machine Learning Algorithms Proceeding of 2018 IEEE International Conference on Current Trends Toward Converging Technologies, , Coimbatore, India; Mikolov, T., Sutskever, I., Chen, K., Corrado, G.S., Dean, J., Distributed representations of words and phrases and their compositionality (2013) Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, p. 26. , C.

Good network performance may give false comfort to mobile operators since it is easy to measured and control but does not lead to the best user perception based Quality of Experience (QoE). We propose a wireless Artificial Intelligence (AI) based system to bridge the gap between network performance and user perception with an ultimate goal to maximize user QoE in 4G LTE networks through Deep Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Sigmoid Activation Functions, both of which are customized for 4G LTE networks. We also implement a Geo-bin solution to enable network performance quantified by Network Performance Healthiness (NPH) Score to better approximate users' true QoE as close as possible. With NPH and Geo-Bin Solution, the ultimate goal of network optimization is shifted from network performance driven to user QoE oriented in a new P2P (from packets to people) paradigm. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Long Term Evolution; Machine Learning; Network Performance Healthiness; Quality of Experience; User Perception","Artificial intelligence; Convolution; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Network performance; Neural networks; Packet networks; Queueing networks; Artifical intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Mobile operators; Network optimization; Network packets; Quality of experience (QoE); Sigmoid activation function; User perceptions; Peer to peer networks",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Ericsson Mobility Report, , June; Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, , 2016-2021 White Paper; 3GPP TS 32.500 Telecommunication Management Self-Organizing Networks (SON); Concepts and Requirements; 501 Telecommunication Management, Self-Configuration of Network Elements, Concepts and Requirements, , 3GPP TS 32; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (E-UTRAN) Self-Configuring and Self-Optimizing Network (SON) Use Cases and Solutions, , 3GPP TS 36.902; Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network, , 3GPP TS 36.902, E-UTRANSelf-Configuring and Self-Optimizing Network (SON) Use Cases and Solutions; Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (UTRA) and Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA, , 3GPP TS 37.320, Radio measurement collection for Minimization of Drive Tests (MDT); Overall description; Fiedler, M., Hossfeld, T., Tran-Gia, P., A generic quantitative relationship between quality of experience and quality of service (2010) IEEE Network, 24 (2); Telecommunication Management-Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for E-UTRAN, , 3GPP TS 32.451; Ouyang, Y., Becht, C., Iyer, K.P., (2016), Washington DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; Ouyang, Y., Becht, C., Lowe, B., (2015), Washington DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office; Ouyang, Y., Yan, T., Profiling wireless resource usage for mobile apps via crowdsourcing-based network analytics (2015) IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 2 (5), pp. 391-398; Ouyang, Y., Li, Z., Lu Su, W.L., Lin, Z., APP-SON: Application characteristics-driven son to optimize 4g/5g network performance and quality of experience (2017) IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BIGDATA); http://www.fiercetelecom.com/sponsored/winners-announced-for-2017-fierce-innovation-awards-telecom-edition; http://tmt.knect365.com/telco-data-analytics-usa/awards; Engels, A., Reyer, M., Xu, X., Mathar, R., Zhang, J., Zhuang, H., Autonomous self-optimization of coverage and capacity in LTE cellular networks (2013) IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology, 62 (5), pp. 1989-2004; Chandrasekhar, V., Andrews, J.G., Spectrum allocation in two-tier networks (2008) Signals, Systems and Computers 2008 42nd Asilomar Conference on, pp. 1583-1587. , October, IEEE; López-Pérez, D., De La Roche, G., Valcarce, A., Juttner, A., Zhang, J., Interference avoidance and dynamic frequency planning for WiMAX femtocells networks (2008) Communication Systems 2008.

Machine learning (ML) is a discipline within AI that deals with learning improvement based on data. Subsequently, retailing and wholesaling, which are known for their high proportion of human work and at the same time low profit margins, can be regarded as a natural fit for the application of AI and ML tools. This article examines the current prevalence of the use of machine learning in the industry. The paper uses two disparate approaches to identify the scientific and practical state-of-the-art within the domain: a literature review on the major scientific databases and an empirical study of the 10 largest international retail companies and their adoption of ML technologies in the domain are combined with each other. This text does not present a prototype using machine learning techniques. Instead of a consideration and comparison of the particular algorythms and approaches, the underling problems and operational tasks that are elementary for the specific domain are identified. Based on a comprehensive literature review the main problem types that ML can serve, and the associated ML techniques, are evaluated. An empirical study of the 10 largest retail companies and their ML adoption shows that the practical market adoption is highly variable. The pioneers have extensively integrated applications into everyday business, while others only show a small set of early prototypes. However, some others show neither active use nor efforts to apply such a technology. Following this, a structured approach is taken to analyze the value-adding core processes of retail companies. The current scientific and practical application scenarios and possibilities are illustrated in detail. In summary, there are numerous possible applications in all areas. In particular, in areas where future forecasts and predictions are needed (like marketing or replenishment), the use of ML today is both scientifically and practically highly developed. © 2019 by the authors.

However, the principles of CMOS operation, involving a switchable semiconductor conductance controlled by an insulating gate, have remained largely unchanged, even as transistors are miniaturized to sizes of 10 nanometres. We investigated what dimensionally scalable logic technology beyond CMOS could provide improvements in efficiency and performance for von Neumann architectures and enable growth in emerging computing such as artifical intelligence. Such a computing technology needs to allow progressive miniaturization, reduce switching energy, improve device interconnection and provide a complete logic and memory family. Here we propose a scalable spintronic logic device that operates via spin–orbit transduction (the coupling of an electron’s angular momentum with its linear momentum) combined with magnetoelectric switching. The device uses advanced quantum materials, especially correlated oxides and topological states of matter, for collective switching and detection. We describe progress in magnetoelectric switching and spin–orbit detection of state, and show that in comparison with CMOS technology our device has superior switching energy (by a factor of 10 to 30), lower switching voltage (by a factor of 5) and enhanced logic density (by a factor of 5). In addition, its non-volatility enables ultralow standby power, which is critical to modern computing. The properties of our device indicate that the proposed technology could enable the development of multi-generational computing. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",,"angular momentum; artificial intelligence; control system; density; electromagnetic field; energy efficiency; operations technology; Article; automation; computer language; electric conductance; information technology; magnetoelectric spin orbit logic; mathematical computing; priority journal; quantum mechanics; signal detection",,,,,"Semiconductor Research Corporation, SRC","Acknowledgements We are grateful to A.

According to an ASCE report, this issue may cost as much as $67 billion per year. Regularly planned condition assessments and repairs of pavement can mitigate any derived costs and increase traffic safety. However, due to the large extent of civil infrastructure networks, required periodic inspections and assessments can be expensive and time-consuming. Further compounding the issue is that the majority of damage assessment mechanisms rely on human visual analysis, which can be prone to potential user bias and errors. In this study, we present a framework to automate roadway assessment by implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that classifies various types of cracks in pavements. CNNs are a special type of deep artificial neural networks that demonstrate high accuracy and efficiency in image-based machine learning tasks. One of the main advantages of CNNs is that they can automatically learn the salient features of an image dataset without any prior knowledge or pre-processing by the user. Thus, the need for feature engineering is obviated and thereby eases the deployment of our assessment framework. Our framework was developed and tested on a balanced dataset containing 400 color images and consisting of four types of pavement damage: (1) longitudinal, (2) transverse, (3) alligator, and (4) pothole cracks. We apply image augmentation using a bundle of transformations to improve the crack classification accuracy of our CNN. The classification accuracy of the four types of cracks was found to be 76.2%.

While extensive effort has been expended designing these algorithms, a comparison between biologically inspired algorithms and naive directional algorithms (travel towards the opponent) has yet to be completed. In this paper, we compare the biological algorithms listed above against a naive control algorithm to assess the effect that these algorithms have on various measures of player experience. The results reveal that the Swarming algorithm, followed closely by Flocking, provide the best gaming experience. However, players noted that the firefly algorithm was most salient. An understanding of the strengths of different behavioural algorithms for NPCs will contribute to the design of algorithms that depict more intelligent crowd behaviour in gaming and computer simulations. © 2019 Canadian Information Processing Society.

The detection, monitoring and identification of space debris can improve space situational awareness, and implement debris avoidance and debris removal tasks. Therefore, this topic has become the basis and premise to ensure the safety of spacecraft operation. In order to meet the requirements of space debris detection and removal, this paper proposed the space debris image processing algorithms including fixed-mode noise estimation and removal, random noise suppression, image enhancement and so on. By using which, the ability of image SNR improved more than 10%, while the image detail resolution improved 10%. On the basis of image processing, the deep neural network mode has been established and combined with the artificial marker semi-supervised training method.

As a result of increased use of sensors and networked machines in manufacturing operations, artificial intelligence techniques play a key role to derive meaningful value from big data infrastructure. These techniques can inform decision making and can enable the implementation of more sustainable practices in the manufacturing industry. In machining processes, a considerable amount of waste (scrap) is generated as a result of failure to monitor a tool condition. Therefore, an intelligent tool condition monitoring system is developed in this paper to identify sustainability-related manufacturing tradeoffs and a set of optimal machining conditions by monitoring the status of the machine tool. An evolutionary algorithm-based multi-objective optimization is used to find the optimal operating conditions, and the solutions are visualized using a Pareto optimal front. © 2019 The Authors.

Previously, several attempts have been made to train AI using medical images for clinical applications. However, whether AI can distinguish microscopic images of mammalian cells has remained debatable. This study assesses the accuracy of image recognition techniques using the CNN to identify microscopic images. We also attempted to distinguish between mouse and human cells and their radioresistant clones. We used phase-contrast microscopic images of radioresistant clones from two cell lines, mouse squamous cell carcinoma NR-S1, and human cervical carcinoma ME-180. We obtained 10,000 images of each of the parental NR-S1 and ME-180 controls as well as radioresistant clones. We trained the CNN called VGG16 using these images and obtained an accuracy of 96%. Features extracted by the trained CNN were plotted using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, and images of each cell line were well clustered. Overall, these findings suggest the utility of image recognition using AI for predicting minute differences among phase-contrast microscopic images of cancer cells and their radioresistant clones. Significance: This study demonstrates rapid and accurate identification of radioresistant tumor cells in culture using artifical intelligence; this should have applications in future preclinical cancer research. © 2018 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"animal cell; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cell differentiation; controlled study; convolutional neural network; gamma irradiation; human; human cell; image recognition; imaging and display; measurement accuracy; mouse; nonhuman; phase contrast microscopy; prediction; priority journal; radiosensitivity; validation process; animal; image processing; neoplasm; pathology; phase contrast microscopy; phenotype; radiation tolerance; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Mice; Microscopy, Phase-Contrast; Neoplasms; Neural Networks (Computer); Phenotype; Radiation Tolerance",,,,,"Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development, AMED; Chugai Pharmaceutical; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, JSPS: 16H06279, 17H04282, 17K19698, 18K08617, 18K16355, 18K16356, 18KK0251; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, MEXT: 15H05791, 16K15615; Ono Pharmaceutical","We thank the laboratory staff for their helpful discussions.

Serious Games is not a new technology trigger, but has always been closely linked to learning. Various factors influencing the development of Serious Games have led to a very diverse, interprofessional and interdisciplinary field of research and application. Conclusions: Serious Games (for Health) and playful applications like gamification offer great potential for work in prevention, health promotion, medicine and health education. Due to the widespread use of the medium of play as an integral aspect of everyday life and culture, the achievement of hard-to-reach groups through this type of medium is very well possible. Aspects such as immersion, flow, storytelling and high interactivity and direct feedback make games an effective intervention strategy. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","Artifical intelligence; Edutainment; Games; Health promotion; Prevention","achievement; army; article; artificial intelligence; field study; health promotion; human; human experiment; immersion; learning; narrative; storytelling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abt, C.C., (1970) Serious games, , Viking Press, New York; Abt, C.C., (1987) Serious games, , University Press of America, Lanham; Akl, E.A., Pretorius, R.W., Sackett, K., The effect of educational games on medical students’ learning outcomes: a systematic review: BEME guide (2010) Med Teach, 32 (14), pp. 16-27; Arnab, S., Lim, T., Carvalho, M.B., Mapping learning and game mechanics for serious games analysis (2015) Br J Educ Technol, 46, pp. 391-411; (2016) Prävention: Elektronischer Gesundheitscoach für fittere Mitarbeiter, , https://www.aerztezeitung.de/praxis_wirtschaft/betriebsmedizin/article/919103/praevention-elektronischer-gesundheitscoach-fittere-mitarbeiter.html; Azuma, R.T., A survey of augmented reality (1997) Presence Teleoperator.

More recently, considerable progress has been made in engineering deep-learning architectures that can accept non-Euclidean data such as graphs and manifolds: geometric deep learning. This progress is of considerable interest to the drug discovery community, as molecules can naturally be represented as graphs, where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges.

Scholars have worked extensively on Chronic Kidney Diseases (CKD) and most of their works are on pure statistical models thereby creating a lot of gaps for Machine Learning (ML) based model to explore. In this paper, we will review existing techniques, and propose a better technique based on Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model with a combination of three feature selection technique for a fast and accurate diagnosis of CKD with relevant symptoms. The CKD model developed in this paper has an accuracy of 0.976, which is better than the baseline models currently existing. Also, the sensitivity and specificity of the CKD model for 36 patients is 1.0 and 0.917 respectively. False diagnosis of CKD patients using this model is reduced greatly. The proposed model will reduce the cost of diagnosing CKD and it can be easily embedded in a CDSS. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Learning systems; Program diagnostics; Artifical intelligence; Automatic diagnosis; Baseline models; Chronic kidney disease; Feature selection techniques; Gradient boosting; Positive changes; Sensitivity and specificity; Computer aided diagnosis",,,,,"113340; Ernest Oppenheimer Memorial Trust","Qing-Guo WANG and Adeola OGUNLEYE acknowledges the financial support of the National Research Foundation of South Africa (Grant Number: 113340) and Oppenheimer Memorial Trust grant, which partially funded his research on this work.",,,,,,,,,,"Pippa, G., Chronic kidney disease on the rise in SA (2015) Life Healthcare; Palace, C., Vegas, L., Kotanko, P., York, N., Levin, N.W., Ronco, C., Advances in chronic kidney disease (2016) International Journal of Molecular Sciences, 36 (3-4), pp. 147-150. , http://www.karger.com?doi=10.1159/000357165; Moosa, M.R., Van, W.D.I., Naicker, S., Meyers, A.M., Important causes of chronic kidney disease in South Africa (2015) South African Medical Journal, 105 (4), pp. 1-8; Naicker, S., End-stage renal disease in sub-saharan and South Africa (2003) Kidney International-Supplement, 63, pp. S119-S122; Herrmannsen, K., Thousands may die without life-saving dialysis (2015) HEALTH-E NEWS, pp. 1-2. , health-e.org.za/2015/03/12/thousands-may-die-without-life-saving-dialysis/; Ningshan, L., Application of radial basis function neural network to estimate glomerular filtration rate in Chinese patients with chronic kidney disease (2010) International Conference on Computer Application and System Modeling (ICCASM 2010) No. Iccasm, pp. 332-335; Salekin, A., Stankovic, J., Detection of chronic kidney disease and selecting important predictive attributes (2016) IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics; Gupta, D., Khare, S., Aggarwal, A., A method to predict diagnostic codes for chronic diseases using machine learning techniques (2016) 2016 International Conference on Computing, Communication and Automation (ICCCA), pp. 281-287. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7813730/; Al-Hyari, A.Y., Al-Taee, A.M., Al-Taee, M.A., Clinical decision support system for diagnosis and management of Chronic Renal Failure (2013) 2013 IEEE Jordan Conference on Applied Electrical Engineering and Computing Technologies (AEECT), pp. 1-6. , http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6716440; Provost, T., Fawcett, F., The case against accuracy estimation for comparing induction algorithms (1998) Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 445-453",,"14th IEEE International Conference on Control and Automation, ICCA 2018","12 June 2018 through 15 June 2018",,138930,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053150252

In the next few years, it will transform virtually every industry, including the $10 trillion transportation market. Soon, autonomous cars, trucks and buses will increase road safety, improve efficiency, and provide access to those with limited mobility. However, developing autonomous vehicles is one of the biggest technical challenges ever faced. New datacenter infrastructure and in-vehicle supercomputing platforms are required, and AI is being used to process data from cameras, radars, lidars and other sensors for various levels of autonomous driving both on the highway and in cities. Algorithms leveraging structure from motion, sensor fusion and deep learning will help perceive the environment, create HD maps, predict traffic and behavior and then control traffic. Furthermore, to ensure AVs are safer than human driven vehicles, developers need to drive millions if not billions of miles to properly train and test them. Combining photorealistic simulation and AI, NVIDIA is also enabling the industry to safely drive billions of miles in virtual reality – testing an unlimited variety of conditions and scenarios. The result is a safer, more scalable, and more cost-effective way to develop, test, validate self-driving vehicles. © 2018, VDI Verlag GMBH.

This indicator, being a measure of success in terms of healthcare, is not synonymous with quality of life and will increase healthcare costs. Associated with this problem are also the changes in terms of the organization of society, which has not been able to solve these constraints of functional limitations, dementia, social isolation, and loneliness. This paper presents the concept of adaptive surveillance based on mobile technology and artificial intelligence, presented in the context of a global physical activity monitoring program (MOVIDA), in his domus dimension designed to the elderly people with some functional limitation or dementia. The proposed solution for an adaptive surveillance is thus to conduct direct supervision programs, to enroll persons who live alone or in nursing homes who need supervision without limiting their individual autonomy. The preliminary results show that it is possible to use the data obtained from a mobile smartphone to identify routines and use this information to identify daily patterns. Changes to these routine patterns can be used to generate alarms for caregivers. © 2018 The Authors.","Adaptive Surveillance; Artifical Intelligence; EHealth; Mobile Health","eHealth; Information systems; Information use; mHealth; Monitoring; Neurodegenerative diseases; Project management; Adaptive monitoring; Adaptive surveillances; Artifical intelligence; Average life expectancy; Health care costs; Mobile Technology; Physical activity monitoring; World Health Organization; Information management",,,,,"02/SAICT/2016 – 23878","This work was supported by Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia FCT-Portugal, under the scope of MOVIDA project: 02/SAICT/2016 – 23878",,,,,,,,,,"(2016) APP, , http://www.app.com.pt/relatorio-mundial-deenvelhecimento-e-saude-da-organizacao-mundial-da-saude-oms-2015, 06 Março Online.

Since these are primarily walking tasks, it is becoming increasingly important to simulate realistic two-dimensional trajectories of assembly operators. However, most tools being currently used for that purpose are primary based on static path planners which do not consider dynamic obstacles. Consequently, simulated walk paths may significantly differ from their corresponding plan or even lead to collisions. Moreover, recent works present dynamic path planners generating trajectories while avoiding collisions in a dynamic environment. However, these approaches are not broadly available since their higher code complexity showed to be a major hurdle for commercial planning tools. In order to bridge the gap between widely spread static and primarily neglected time-dynamic planners, this paper contributes to a utilization of static path planners in dynamic environments. While maintaining the simplicity of static path planners, the novel heuristic method allows to model the time sensitive change of the surrounding regardless of the specific path planner implementations. The validity of the proposed approach has been proven using 5000 procedurally generated test scenarios. Moreover, the benefits of the proposed method were further outlined in an exemplary use case, representing a realistic production scenario. © 2017 The Authors.","Artifical intelligence; Dynamic path planning; Factory planning; Intelligent agent; Lazy theta; Production planning","Automotive industry; Collision avoidance; Heuristic methods; Intelligent agents; Iterative methods; Manufacture; Motion planning; Planning; Production control; Trajectories; Artifical intelligence; Dynamic path planning; Factory planning; Lazy theta; Production Planning; Assembly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Manns, M., Martin, N.A.A., Improving A∗walk trajectories with B-splines and motion capture for manual assembly verification (2015) Procedia CIRP, 33, pp. 365-370; Agethen, P., Otto, M., Mengel, S., Rukzio, E., Using Marker-less Motion Capture Systems for Walk Path Analysis in Paced Assembly Flow Lines (2016) Procedia CIRP, 54, pp. 152-157; https://www.ipoplan.de/, IPO.

Gaussian process Bayesian optimization techniques are developed to automatically learn global Gaussian process surrogate models, which provide statistical performance predictions in both explored and unexplored areas of the parameter space. This allows a learning engine to sample full-combat simulations at parameter values that are most likely to optimize performance and provide highly informative data points for improving future predictions. However, standard Gaussian process Bayesian optimization methods do not provide a reliable surrogate model for the highly volatile objective functions found in aerial combat and thus do not reliably identify global maxima. These issues are addressed by novel repeat sampling and hybrid repeat/multipoint sampling techniques. Simulation studies show that hybrid repeat/multipoint sampling improves the accuracy of Gaussian process surrogate models, allowing artificial-intelligence decision makers to more accurately predict performance and efficiently tune parameters. © 2018 American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

With advances in connectivity, ICSs are now, typically, connected to communications networks and, as a result, can be accessed remotely. This extends the attack surface to include the potential for sophisticated cyber attacks, which can adversely impact ICS operation, resulting in service interruption, equipment damage, safety concerns, and associated financial implications. In this work, a novel cyber-physical security framework for ICSs is proposed, which incorporates an analytics tool for attack detection and executes a reliable estimation-based attackresilient control policy, whenever an attack is detected. The proposed framework is adaptable to already implemented ICS and the stability and optimal performance of the controlled system under attack has been proved. The performance of the proposed framework is evaluated using a reduced order model of a real EMS site and simulated attacks. © 2017 IEEE.","Artifical intelligence; Building management systems; Cyber-physical security; Energy management; Industrial control; Knowledge-based systems; Resilient control; SCADA systems; Security analytics; Stability; Virtual sensor","Convergence of numerical methods; Cyber Physical System; Energy management; Energy management systems; Intelligent buildings; Knowledge based systems; Network security; SCADA systems; System stability; Artifical intelligence; Building management system; Cyber-Physical securities; Industrial controls; Resilient control; Security Analytics; Virtual sensor; Intelligent control",,,,,"Seventh Framework Programme, FP7: 608224; Vetenskapsrådet, VR: 2013-5523, 2016-0861; Seventh Framework Programme, FP7; Myndigheten för Samhällsskydd och Beredskap, MSB","Manuscript received March 6, 2017; revised May 29, 2017; accepted July 5, 2017.

In the first years of the third millennium the discussion regained momentum, when, thanks to the development of hardware and software technology, leading researchers and practitioners of Artifical Intelligence raised with new systems, new visions and new theories the challenge of machines versus human intelligence. In this text I will shortly survey this debate, dwelling a bit 'longer on its last phase, having its climax in recent years. I will adopt a viewpoint that, avoiding discussing the ethical legitimacy or the reliability of the objectives of Artificial Intelligence, tries to reword them, from the viewpoint of the people being their stakeholders. Even if human intelligence has dimensions that artificial 'super' intelligence cannot take into consideration, cognitive computing systems, in fact, have become really and definitively better, at the level of pure rationality, than human beings. Instead of putting machines in competition with human beings I suggest to consider them 'rational' aids and/or supports of the latter. Cognitive Computing technology, with its superior capability of rationally ordering data and information, can help users to internalize those rational criteria enriching their capability of sharing their knowledge creation processes while facing innovative problems or situations.","Cognitive computing; Rationality; Situated knowledge",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bannon, L., Bjørn, P., De Michelis, G., Paternò, F., Randall, D., Schmidt, K., Wagner, I., Wulf, V., Building a Socially Embedded Future Interne.

There are many questions in the public about how these AI/AS programs will make ethical decisions as well as what ethical issues will be dealt with at a developmental level. Darning AI/AS development, these choices are mainly developed by personal choice of the developers which is an objective view of any issue on how to handle difficult situations. In most conversation about AI/AS control, people have an issue with how ethical decisions are made or which decision is made prompting them to want human intervention during these situations. The IEEE Standards Association (SA) has been developing a set of basic guidelines to help alleviate some of the ambiguity of these sensitive issues. This paper is a literature review of AI/AS design guidelines and a case study of different incidence that AI/AS systems could be involved in producing many of the social and ethical quandaries brought on by AI/AS system development. © 2017 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Autonomous Systems; Ethics","Artificial intelligence; Systems engineering; Artifical intelligence; Autonomous systems; Ethics; Focus of researches; Human intervention; Ieee standards associations; Literature reviews; System development; Philosophical aspects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"NSC Motor Vehicle Fatality Estimates; Road Crash Statistics, , http://asirt.org/initiatives/informing-road-users/road-safety-facts/road-crash-statistics, [Accessed: 01-Sep-2017]; Bonnefon, J.-F., Shariff, A., Rahwan, I., (2015) The Social Dilemma of Autonomous Vehicles, (JUNE); Bringsjord, S., Arkoudas, K., Bello, P., IEEE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS Toward a General Logicist Methodology for Engineering Ethically Correct Robots; Bostrom, N., Overcoming Bias: Moral Uncertainty - Towards a Solution?, , http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html, [Accessed: 01-Sep-2017]; (2016) IEEE Ethically Aligned Design; Ethics Commission Creates World's First Initial Guidelines for Autonomous Vehicles, , http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/_pr/P_Wash/2017/06/21-AutonomousVehicles.html?archive=3393378, [Accessed: 01-Sep-2017]; (2010) Principles of Robotics, , https://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/principlesofrobotics/, [Accessed: 01-Sep-2017]; (2017) Tenets | Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, , https://www.partnershiponai.org/tenets/, [Accessed: 01-Sep-2017]","IEEE;IEEE Systems Council","3rd Annual IEEE International Symposium on Systems Engineering, ISSE 2017","11 October 2017 through 13 October 2017",,131953,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040098072

An efficient energy management strategy for smart homes results in minimized electricity consumption leading to cost savings. Towards this goal, we investigate the impact of environmental factors on home energy consumption. Home energy demand is observed to be affected by environmental factors such as temperature, wind speed and humidity which are inherently uncertain. Analyzing the impact of these factors on electricity consumption is challenging due to the unpredictability of weather conditions and non-linear relationship between environmental factors and electricity demand. For demand estimation based on these time varying factors, a hybrid intelligent system is developed that integrates the adaptability of neural networks and reasoning of fuzzy systems to predict daily electricity demand. A smart home dataset is utilized to build an unsupervised artificial neural network known as the Self-Organizing Map (SOM). We further develop a fuzzy rule based system from the SOM to predict home energy demand. Evaluation of the system shows a strong correlation between home energy demand and environmental factors and that the system predicts home energy consumption with higher accuracy.

The proposed DSS assists decision-makers to reuse or adapt the available fixtures or to manufacture new fixtures depending upon the similarity between the past and new cases. It considers the cost effectiveness of the proposed decision when an adaptation decision is passed. Design/methodology/approach - The research problem is addressed by integrating case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning and fuzzy set theory. Cases are represented using an object-oriented (OO) approach to characterize them by their feature vectors. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and the inverse of weighted Euclidean distance measure are applied for case retrieval. A machining operation is illustrated as a computational example to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed DSS. Findings - The problems of fixture assignment and control have not been well-addressed in the past, although fixture management is one of the complex problems in manufacturing. The proposed DSS is a promising approach to address such kinds of problems using the three components of an artificial intelligence and FAHP. Research limitations/implications - Although the DSS is tested in a laboratory environment using a numerical example, it has not been validated in real industrial systems. Practical implications - The DSS is proposed in terms of simple rules and equations. This implies that it is not complex for software development and implementation. The illustrated numerical example indicates that the proposed DSS can be implemented in the real-world. Originality/value - Demand-driven fixture retrieval and manufacture to assign the right fixtures to planned part-orders using an intelligent DSS is the main contribution. It provides special consideration for the adaptation of the available fixtures in a system. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Analytical hierarchy process; Artifical intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Fuzzy sets; Object-oriented methods","Artificial intelligence; Case based reasoning; Computation theory; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Fixtures (tooling); Fuzzy set theory; Fuzzy sets; Industrial research; Inverse problems; Manufacture; Object oriented programming; Software design; Analytical Hierarchy Process; Artifical intelligence; Decision support system (dss); Design/methodology/approach; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Intelligent decision support systems; Object oriented method; Weighted euclidean distance; Decision support systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aamodt, A., Plaza, E., Case-based reasoning: Foundational issues, methodological variations, and system approaches (1994) AI Communications, 7 (1), pp. 39-59; Bellman, R.E., Zadeh, L.A., Decision-making in a fuzzy environment (1970) Management Science, 17 (4), pp. 141-164; Bi, Z.M., Zhang, W.J., Flexible fixture design and automation: Review, issues and future directions (2001) International Journal of Production Research, 39 (13), pp. 2867-2894; Boyle, I., Rong, Y., Brown, D.C., CAFixD: A case-based reasoning fixture design method: Framework and indexing mechanisms (2006) Journal of Computing and Information Science in Engineering, 6 (1), pp. 40-48; Boyle, I., Rong, Y., Brown, D.C., A review and analysis of current computer-aided fixture design approaches (2011) Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, 27 (1), pp. 1-12; Buckley, J.J., Fuzzy hierarchical analysis (1985) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 17 (3), pp. 233-247; Carlsson, C., Fullér, R., Fuzzy multiple criteria decision making: Recent developments (1996) Fuzzy Sets and Systems, 78 (2), pp. 139-153; Chang, P.-C., Liu, C.-H., Lai, R.K., A fuzzy case-based reasoning model for sales forecasting in print circuit board industries (2008) Expert Systems with Applications, 34 (3), pp. 2049-2058; Chen, S.-J., Hwang, C.-L., (1992) Fuzzy Multiple Attribute Decision Making: Methods and Applications, , Springer- Verlag, Berlin and Heidelberg; Chi, R.T.H., Kiang, M.Y., An integrated approach of rule-based and case-based reasoning for decision support (1991) Proceedings of the 19th Annual Conference on Computer Science, pp. 255-267. , ACM, New York, NY; Chioua, H.-K., Tzeng, G.-H., Cheng, D.-C., Evaluating sustainable fishing development strategies using fuzzy MCDM approach (2005) Omega: The International Journal of Management Science, 33 (3), pp. 223-234; Demirel, T., Demirel, N.C., Kahraman, C., Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process and its application (2008) Fuzzy Multi-criteria Decision Making: Theory and Applications with Recent Developments, pp. 53-83. , Kahraman, C.

There are numerous uses of the computerized reasoning. Normal LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP) is one of the up and coming uses of AI. The objective of the Natural Language Processing is to plan and construct programming that will examine, comprehend, and produce dialects that people utilize actually, so that in the long run you will have the capacity to address your PC as if you were tending to someone else. Common Language Processing is the utilization of PCs to prepare composed and talked dialect for some pragmatic, helpful, reason: to make an interpretation of dialects, to get data from the web on content information banks in order to answer inquiries, to bear on discussions with machines, and to get guidance about, say, annuities et cetera. Functional utilizations of normal dialect preparing are machine interpretation, database get to, data recovery, content classification, extricating information from content etc. Still no such totally working framework has grown yet research is going on. What’s more, it might be done soon. Some fundamental frameworks are as of now created like ELIZA, INTELLISHRINK, and AMALGAM and so forth. © 2016, International Journal of Pharmacy and Technology.

Such a scheme algorithmically constructs an online algorithm with a competitive ratio arbitrarily close to the best possible competitive ratio for any online algorithm. We study the problem of scheduling jobs online to minimize the weighted sum of completion times on parallel, related, and unrelated machines, and we derive both deterministic and randomized algorithms that are almost best possible among all online algorithms of the respective settings. We also generalize our techniques to arbitrary monomial cost functions and apply them to the makespan objective. Our method relies on an abstract characterization of online algorithms combined with various simplifications and transformations. We also contribute algorithmic means to compute the actual value of the best possible competitive ratio up to an arbitrary accuracy. This strongly contrasts with nearly all previous manually obtained competitiveness results, and, most importantly, it reduces the search for the optimal competitive ratio to a question that a computer can answer. We believe that our concept can also be applied to many other problems and yields a new perspective on online algorithms in general. © 2016 ACM.","Algorithms; Competitive analysis; Design; F.1.2 [computation by abstract devices]: modes of Computation - online computation; F.2.2 [analysis of algorithms and problem complexity]: nonnumerical algorithms and problems - computations on discrete structures; G.2.2 [discrete mathematics]: combinatorics - combinatorial algorithms; G.2.3 [discrete mathematics]: applications; I.2.8 [artifical intelligence]: problem solving, control methods and search - scheduling; Jobs arrive over time; Makespan; Min-sum objective; Online scheduling; Theory","Algorithms; Computational complexity; Cost functions; Design; Scheduling; Combinatorics; Competitive analysis; Control methods; Discrete mathematics; Jobs arrive over time; Makespan; Min-sum; Online computations; Online scheduling; Problem complexity; Theory; Problem solving",,,,,"Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst, DAAD; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: ME 3825/1","Elisabeth Lübbecke and Olaf Maurer were supported by the DFG Research center MATHEON Mathematics for key technologies in Berlin.

Research in interactive narrative (IN) uses automated planning to generate story plans for a given story problem. However, a story planner can generate multiple story plan solutions, all of which equally-satisfy the story problem definition but contain different story content. These differences in story content are key to understanding the story branches in a story problem's solution space, however we lack narrative-theoretic metrics to compare story plans. We address this gap by first defining a story plan summarization model to capture the important story semantics from a story plan. Secondly, we define a story plan comparison metric that compares story plans based on the summarization model. Using the Glaive narrative planner and a simple story problem, we demonstrate the usefulness of using the summarization model and distance metric to characterize the different story branches in a story problem's solution space. © Adam Amos-Binks, David L.

Joining and pruning operations a re implemented as Apriori algorithm with O(1) time complexity. Ancestor-brother express is used to store the sort tree. If an ancestor does not exist in a transaction, all the brother nodes with the same ancestor will be skipped. So the time performance of counting support can be improved.

In this study, an innovative human-machine welding paradigm, virtualized welding, is proposed that can transfer human intelligence to welding robots. A welding robot is augmented with sensors to observe the welding process and performs actual welding. A human welder operates a virtual welding torch and freely adjusts its movement in 3D space based on the visual feedback from the sensors. The adjustments together with the reconstructed 3D weld pool surfaces are recorded, analyzed, and utilized to form models representing human welder intelligence. To demonstrate the concepts behind the virtualized welding system and modeling method proposed, human welder’s adjustments are “selectively” learned and transferred to the welding robot to perform automated gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW).

These are primarily due to variable, complex and un-measurable factors and noises influencing the process behavior. However, such cases are most appropriate application areas of Expert Systems. In process industry, Expert Systems are one of the successful application areas of Artificial Intelligence, where expertise and knowledge of a Process Expert or a group of Experts are embedded as computer inference software and database. In a real time situation, these systems can take intelligent decisions as would have been taken by process Expert on a similar situation. Determination of exact Set Process Temperatures or thermal regime on different parts of Rolling Mill Furnaces like Annealing Furnace in a Steel Industry is an intriguing problem. However, this decision is very crucial as final mechanical and metallurgical quality of steel stock significantly depends on fixing and accurate control of these temperatures. But as a irony, no well defined mathematical co-relations are available, which can predict exact thermal regime to be followed to achieve desired quality and properties of steel coils / sheets under heating inside such furnaces. The aforesaid intriguing issue has been successfully resolved by development and implementation of Expert System guided heating control system through prediction and control of optimum furnace temperatures inside Annealing Furnaces at Cold Rolling Mill of Bokaro Steel Plant and Decarburization-Annealing Furnace at Silicon Steel Mill of Rourkela Steel Plant. In both the cases, concepts of hierarchical automation has been used, wherein Expert System comprising Level-II tier of automation predicts most appropriate thermal regime to obtain desired product quality for a given set of steel sheet. A seamlessly dovetailed PLC constitutes Level-I automation layer. PLC monitors and controls the plant as per advice from Expert System. Both the systems have enhanced plants efficiency by improving production, quality and energy conservation. © 2016 IEEE.","Annealing; Artifical Intelligence; Expert System; Hierarchical Automation; OPC; PLC","Annealing; Application programs; Artificial intelligence; Automation; Cold rolling; Cold rolling mills; Embedded systems; Expert systems; Furnaces; Iron and steel plants; Programmable logic controllers; Quality control; Real time systems; Silicon steel; Steel metallurgy; Steelmaking; Artifical intelligence; Furnace temperatures; Hierarchical control; Intelligent decisions; Metallurgical quality; Prediction and control; Process industries; Process temperature; Process control",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Fan, X., Chen, X., Wang, Y., (2010) Expert System for Sintering Process Control, , InTech, January; Zhuwu, M., (2005) Automation for Ironmaking, , Metallurgy Industry Press, Beijing; Yanga, C., Wua, M., Shena, D., Deconinck, G., Hybrid intelligent control of gas collectors of coke ovens (2001) Control Engineering Practice, 9, pp. 725-733; Min, W.U., Nakano, M., She, J., A Model-Based Expert Control Strategy using Neural Networks for the Coal Blending Process in an Iron and Steel Plant (1999) Expert System with Applications, 16 (3), pp. 271-281; Mishra, S., Mahajan, G.J., Mitra, S., Majumdar, S., Gangadaran, M., Jayaswal, N.P., Krishnaswamy, K., Bedi, B.S., Control System for hood annealing (1997) Asia Steel, pp. 254-256; Amano, S., Takarabe, T., Nakamori, T., Oda, H., Taira, M., Watanabe, S., Seki, T., Expert System for Blast Furnace Operation at Kimitsu Works (1990) ISIJ International, 30 (2), pp. 105-110; Dorn, J., Expert System in Steelmaking Technology, , Christen Doppler Laboratory for Expert System, Vienna University; Siemens, V.A.I., SIMETALCIS BF VAiron, , Blast Furnace Expert System","","1st IEEE International Conference on Control, Measurement and Instrumentation, CMI 2016","8 January 2016 through 10 January 2016",,119500,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964354539

At first the original message is converted into six face cubical form (3 × 3 × 3 cube) and the cube is chosen as it is easy to scramble the message in cubical form. Rotation types and angle of rotations are generated using random function which is used as an encryption key, randomness in the key make encryption stronger. There are 18 possible rotation types and each rotation can have any one of the 3 different rotation angles. Finally cube layers are rotated for 18 times in any of the three different angles by using the encryption key value. The cube layers rotated here are as same as the simple Rubik’s cube rotation. At the end of rotation, the original message cube is scrambled to give the unpredictable pattern. Random rotations used in this approach produce secure cipher text, which is unbreakable from cryptanalysis without the encryption key. Intention of this research is to provide secure and novel approach of artificial intelligence scrambling technique to the encryption field. In this algorithm we used cubical scrambling methods and novel way of representing text in cube format. Algorithm’s experimental result in each phase of scrambling is shown with comparative analysis of text position in cipher message with original message. Analysis of result shows that original message is scrambled and provided the secure and unpredictable message; hence the novelty of this Artifical intelligence scrambling approach is evidenced. © 2016, Scientific Publishers of India.

Two basic steps for an adaption of an automated production system to a new task are the reconfiguration and the reprogramming. Against this background, the central objective of this paper is the discussion of a new concept to simplify the application of task-oriented programming for assembly systems. Only abstract tasks are described in the task-oriented programming. The deduction of control code is done in a programming system. The advantages of task-oriented programming in means of time and complexity are often negated by the necessary effort to adapt a task-oriented programming system to the components and processes in a specific production system. Therefore, an adaptable taskoriented programming system that can be customized easily is the current research focus of the authors. The core of a task-oriented programming system is a planning module, in which the task description is transferred in code for the control of the system. Main subjects in the planning process are the separation in sub-steps as well as the identification of appropriate parameters and the chronological sequence of the sub-steps. Depending on the application (for example welding, gluing or pick and place operations) different algorithms and process knowledge are necessary. In this article a highly adaptable planning module based on a blackboard architecture and vendor independent device descriptions is discussed. The structural design of the planning module, its constituent parts and the description techniques for skills as well as products and processes are outlined. The advantages of the concept are illustrated by adapting the planning module for an industrial welding process. © 2014 The Authors.","Artifical intelligence; Flexible manufacturing system (FMS); Robot","Abstracting; Assembly; Flexible manufacturing systems; Intelligent robots; Manufacture; Product design; Riveting; Robot programming; Robots; Structural design; Welding; Artifical intelligence; Automated production systems; Blackboard architecture; Chronological sequences; Device description; Programming system; Task-oriented programming; Task-oriented programming system; Computer systems programming",,,,,"02PR2081; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung, BMBF","The authors of this paper would like to thank the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and the Project Management Agency Research Center Karlsruhe (PTKA-PFT) for the sponsoring (Funding code 02PR2081).",,,,,,,,,,"Lieberman, L.I., Thomas, J., AUTOPASS: An automatic programming system for computer controlled mechanical assembly (1977) IBM Journal of Research and Development, New York, 21 (4), pp. 321-333; Nevins, J.L., Whitney, D.E., (1989) Concurrent Design of Product and Process, , New York McGraw-Hill; Martin-Vega, L.A., Brown, H.K., Shaw, W.H., Sanders, T.J., Industrial perspective on the research needs and opportunities in manufacturing assembly (1995) Journal of Manufacturing Systems, 14 (1), pp. 45-48; Kleineidam, G., (1990) CAD/CAP: Computerbasierte Montagefeinplanung, 12. , Ph.D. dissertation, Universität Erlangen-Nörnberg, Reihe Fertigungstechnik-Erlangen; Mönchen, Wien: Hanser Verlag; Naumann, M., Wegener, K., Schraft, K., Control architecture for robot cells to enable plugnproduce (2007) IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA, 2007, pp. 287-292. , S.

Despite the techniques used in an algorithm being the key factor of the whole system, the evaluation of candidate solutions also plays an important role. In this paper, the proposed algorithm Macroscopic Indeterminacy Swarm Optimization (MISO) presents a new search scheme with indeterminate moment of evaluation. Here, we perform an experiment based on public benchmark functions. The results produced by MISO, Differential Evolution (DE) with various settings, Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Simplified Swarm Optimization (SSO), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) have been compared.

Although it is complex, it is very important in the field repair decision at wartime. Through the optimal field repair scheduling, we can reduce the total repair time and improve repair efficiency. Regretly ship field repair scheduling optimization model has not been researched perfectly. Generally speaking, there are field repair processes of two kinds. Repair processe of one kind is that the repair sequence is fixed and the repair resource need not be scheduled. It is used to schedule repair tasks of the same kind. Repair processe of the other kind is that the repair resoure should be scheduled to reduce the total repair time. It is used to schedule the repair tasks of the different kind. The scheduling method of the first kind has been researched in math work. But the math model turns to be complex when the amount of the object increases. The scheduling method of the second kind is more complex than the first one. It is a typical asynchronism and concurrency process. So the new feasible models should be researched. Based on the repair processes of the two kinds, two ship field repair scheduling models are founded based on timed colored Petri net (TCPN) and depth first search method in this paper. The timed colored Petri net is used to model repair process and its transition rules are used to design the arithmetic. The arithmetics of the two models are explained in detail. In the second arithmetic, the conflict-solution is researched particularly. Conflict-solution method is corresponding to the field repair resource scheduling plan. The conflict-solution problem is solved based on depth first search method of artifical intelligence. Through the examples of the use of the two arithmetics, we find that the arithmetics given in this paper are very feasible and convenient. The field repair scheduling optimization models are the basic of the ship field repair and safety recovery intelligent decision support system. Through the optimization models we can generate the repair scheduling plan intelligently. That is to say the two models are not only optimization models but also intelligent models. © (2013) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Conflict-solution; Depth first search; Optimization; Repair scheduling; Timed colored petri net","Artifical intelligence; Conflict-solution; Depth first search; Intelligent decision support systems; Optimization models; Resource-scheduling; Scheduling optimization; Timed colored Petri net; Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Information science; Mathematical models; Optimization; Research; Scheduling; Shipbuilding; Ships; Turnaround time; Repair",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jin-Yun, P., (2001) The Ship Survivability, pp. 276-320. , Beijing: Hai-chao press; Roach, L.K.A., (1994) Methodology For Battle Damage Repair (BDR) Analysis, , U.S.Army Research Laboratory, AD-A276 083; Mao-Zhi, G., (1999) The Maintenance Engineering of Military Equipment, , Defense industry press; Jian-Ping, L., (2000) The Theory and Application of the First-aid Repair of Equipment, , Weapon industry press, Bei-jing; Smith, N., Livesay, M., (1992) Field Repair Technology For Battle Damage, , US.Army materials Technology Laboratory, AD-A254678; Peterson, J.L., (1981) Petri Net Theory and Modeling of Systems [M], , Prentice Hall; Du, Y.Y., Jiang, C.J., Modeling and Analysis of an Online Stock Trading System by Temporal Colored Petri Nets (2001) Advances In Systems Science and Applications, 1 (2); Lin, M., Research on the application of Petri net to MTA Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 30 (3); Cheng, S., Huang, L., Peng, S., Kang, J., The optimization of Manufacturing System Based on Material Flow and Capital Flow (2005) Advances In Systems Science and Applications, 5 (2); Shuzhen, Y., Wenlong, Y., Theory and Application of Petri Net [M], , Beijing: Dept. of computer science and engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics","Korea Maritime University;Hong Kong Industrial Technology Research Centre","2013 International Conference on Mechatronics and Industrial Informatics, ICMII 2013","13 March 2013 through 14 March 2013","Guangzhou",97672,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879741204

Furthermore, and in deep contrast with the single objective case, there exists no benchmark problems on which to test the algorithms for multi-objective planning. Divide-and-Evolve (DaE) is an evolutionary planner that won the (single-objective) deterministic temporal satisficing track in the last International Planning Competition. Even though it uses intensively the classical (and hence single-objective) planner YAHSP (Yet Another Heuristic Search Planner), it is possible to turn DaEyahsp into a multiobjective evolutionary planner. A tunable benchmark suite for multi-objective planning is first proposed, and the performances of several variants of multi-objective DaEYAHSP are compared on different instances of this benchmark, hopefully paving the road to further multi-objective competitions in AI planning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",,"Artifical intelligence; Bench-mark problems; Benchmark suites; International Planning Competitions; Multi-objective evolutionary; Multi-objective planning; Multiple objectives; Single objective; Heuristic algorithms; Optimization; Planning",,,,,,"This work was partially funded by DESCARWIN ANR project (ANR-09-COSI-002).",,,,,,,,,,"Ghallab, M., Nau, D., Traverso, P., (2004) Automated Planning, Theory and Practice, , Morgan Kaufmann; Do, M., Kambhampati, S., SAPA: A Multi-Objective Metric Temporal Planner (2003) J.

We treat the image segmentation problem as cell merging in a cellular space constructed in the image plane. A cell is defined to be a pixel or a group of pixels with close RGB values. In each iteration, a cell checks the similarities between itself and its neighboring cells. Cells with similar properties are merged into large cells, which will eventually lead to high quality superpixels. The segmentation process is a trade-off between accuracy and computation cost. We have proved that the proposed approach is able to obtain satisfactory results efficiently while keeping image details. © 2011 IEEE.","artifical intelligence; cellular automata; image proceesing; segmentation; superpixels","Artifical intelligence; Cell merging; Cellular space; Computation costs; High quality; Image plane; image proceesing; Segmentation process; Superpixels; Automata theory; Cells; Cellular automata; Pixels; Signal processing; Image segmentation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mori, G., Guiding model search using segmentation (2005) Proceedings of the Tenth IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2005), 2, pp. 1417-1423. , 17-21 Oct; Kong, H., Gurcan, M., Boussaid, K., Partitioning histopathological Images: An integrated framework for supervised color-texture segmentation and cell splitting (2011) IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging, (99), pp. 1-18; Tarabalka, Y., Chanussot, J., Benediktsson, J.A., Segmentation and classification of hyperspectral images using watershed transformation (2010) Pattern Recognition, 43 (7), pp. 2367-2379. , Jul; Thompson, D.R., Mandrake, L., Gilmore, M.S., Castaño, R., Superpixel endmember detection (2010) IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 48 (11), pp. 4023-4033. , Nov; Drucker, F., MacCormick, J., Fast superpixels for video analysis (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE Workshop on Motion and Video Computing, 2009 (WMVC '09), pp. 1-8. , 8-9 Dec; Fulkerson, B., Vedaldi, A., Soatto, S., Class segmentation and object localization with superpixel neighborhoods (2009) Proceedings of the IEEE 12th International Conference on Computer Vision, pp. 670-677. , Sep. 29- Oct; Vincent, L., Soille, P., Watersheds in digital spaces: An efficient algorithm based on immersion simulations (1991) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 13 (6), pp. 583-598. , DOI 10.1109/34.87344; Comaniciu, D., Meer, P., Mean shift: A robust approach toward feature space analysis (2002) IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 24 (5), pp. 603-619. , DOI 10.1109/34.1000236; Felzenszwalb, P., Huttenlocher, D., Efficient graph-based image segmentation (2004) International Journal of Computer Vision, 59 (2), pp. 167-181; Shi, J., Malik, J., Normalized cuts and image segmentation (2000) IEEE Transcations on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 22 (8), pp. 888-905. , Aug; Moore, A.P., Prince, S.J.D., Warrell, J., Mohammed, U., Jones, G., Superpixel lattices (2008) Proceedings of IEEE Conference on Computer Vission and Pattern Recognition, pp. 1-8; Wolfram, S., (1986) Theory and Applications of Cellular Automata, , New York: World Scientific; Ren, X., Malik, J., Learning a classification model for segmentation (2003) Proceedings of the Ninth International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV 2003), 1, pp. 10-17","Donghua University","4th International Congress on Image and Signal Processing, CISP 2011","15 October 2011 through 17 October 2011","Shanghai",88002,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862972321

A number of studies on artificial neural networks (ANN), fuzzy logic and adaptive neuro-fuzzy systems (ANFIS) were reviewed and important aspects of these models were highlighted. The results of the extensive literature survey showed that most AI-based prediction models were implemented for the solution of water/wastewater (55.7%) and air pollution (30.8%) related environmental problems compared to solid waste (13.5%) management studies. The present literature review indicated that among the many types of ANNs, the three-layer feed-forward and back-propagation (FFBP) networks were considered as one of the simplest and the most widely used network type. In general, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) was found as the best-suited training algorithm for several complex and nonlinear real-life problems of environmental engineering. The literature survey showed that for water and wastewater treatment processes, most of Al-based prediction models were introduced to estimate the performance of various biological and chemical treatment processes, and to control effluent pollutant loads and flowrates from a specific system. In air polution related environmental problems, forecasting of ozone (O 3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels, daily and/or hourly particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) emissions, and sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations were found to be widely modeled. For solid waste management applications, reseachers conducted studies to model weight of waste generation, solid waste composition, and total rate of waste generation. © ICS AS CR 2011.","Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Artificial neural networks; Black-box modeling; Environmental engineering","Air pollution; Backpropagation; Biological water treatment; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Deep neural networks; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Environmental engineering; Forecasting; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy neural networks; Fuzzy systems; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Pollution; Solid wastes; Sulfur dioxide; Surveys; Waste management; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water treatment; Adaptive neuro fuzzy system; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system; Artifical intelligence; Black-box model; Environmental problems; Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm; Training algorithms; Water and wastewater treatments; Fuzzy logic",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Turkdogan-Aydinol, F.I., Yetilmezsoy, K., A fuzzy logic-based model to predict biogas and methane production rates in a pilot-scale mesophilic UASB reactor treating molasses wastewater (2010) J.

It has the property that, even when large, it guarantees fast response to queries. Specifically, a query can be processed in time linear in the size of the query regardless of the size of the compiled knowledge base. The knowledge compilation paradigm typically assumes that the 'intractable part' of the processing be done once, during compilation. This assumption could render updating the knowledge base infeasible if recompilation is required. The ability to install updates without recompilation may therefore considerably widen applicability. In this article, several update operations not requiring recompilation are developed. These include disjunction, substitution of truth constants, conjunction with unit clauses, reordering of variables and conjunction with arbitrary clauses.",,"Artifical intelligence; Fast response; Knowledge base; Knowledge compilation; Lecture Notes; Recompilation; Target language; Data structures; Knowledge based systems",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: IIS-0712752, IIS-0712849","The authors are grateful to the referees, each of whom provided useful suggestions and constructive criticism.

Although it is complex, it is very important in the field repair decision at wartime. Through the optimal field repair scheduling, we can reduce the total repair time and improve repair efficiency. Regretly ship field repair scheduling optimization model has not been researched perfectly. Generally speaking, there are field repair processes of two kinds. Repair processe of one kind is that the repair sequence is fixed and the repair resource need not be scheduled. It is used to schedule repair tasks of the same kind. Repair processe of the other kind is that the repair resoure should be scheduled to reduce the total repair time. It is used to schedule the repair tasks of the different kind. The scheduling method of the first kind has been researched in math work. But the math model turns to be complex when the amount of the object increases. The scheduling method of the second kind is more complex than the first one. It is a typical asynchronism and concurrency process. So the new feasible models should be researched. Based on the repair processes of the two kinds, two ship field repair scheduling models are founded based on timed colored Petri net (TCPN) and depth first search method in this paper. The timed colored Petri net is used to model repair process and its transition rules are used to design the arithmetic. The arithmetics of the two models are explained in detail. In the second arithmetic, the conflict-solution is researched particularly. Conflict-solution method is corresponding to the field repair resource scheduling plan. The conflict-solution problem is solved based on depth first search method of artifical intelligence. Through the examples of the use of the two arithmetics, we find that the arithmetics given in this paper are very feasible and convenient. The field repair scheduling optimization models are the basic of the ship field repair and safety recovery intelligent decision support system. Through the optimization models we can generate the repair scheduling plan intelligently. That is to say the two models are not only optimization models but also intelligent models.","Conflict-solution; Depth first search; Optimization; Repair scheduling; Timed colored petri net",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jin-Yun, P., (2001) The Ship Survivability, pp. 276-320. , Beijing: Hai-chao press; Roach, L.K.A., (1994) Methodology For Battle Damage Repair (BDR) Analysis, , U.S.Army Research Laboratory, AD-A276 083; Gan, M.-Z., (1999) The Maintenance Engineering of Military Equipment, , Defense industry press; Li, J., (2000) The Theory and Application of The First-aid Repair of Equipment, , Weapon industry press, Bei-jing; Smith, N., Livesay, M., (1992) Field Repair Technology For Battle Damage, , US.Army materials Technology Laboratory, AD-A254678; Peterson, J.L., (1981) Petri Net Theory and Modeling of Systems[M], , Prentice Hall; Du, Y.Y., Jiang, C.J., Modeling and Analysis of an Online Stock Trading System by Temporal Colored Petri Nets (2001) Advances In Systems Science and Applications, 1, p. 2; Ma, L., Research on the application of Petri net to MTA Journal of Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, 30, p. 3; Cheng, S., Huang, L., Peng, S., Kang, J., The optimization of Manufacturing System Based on Material Flow and Capital Flow (2005) Advances In Systems Science and Applications, 5, p. 2; Yao, S., Yang, W., Theory and Application of Petri Net[M], , Beijing: Dept. of computer science and engineering, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics; Tan, X., Gao, R., Feng, E., Wang, B., Optimal Treatment Planning for a Gamma Knife Unit (2004) Advances In Systems Science and Applications, 4, p. 2; (2003) Operational Research Teaching Book Compiling Group, , Operational Research, TSinghua University Press, Beijing; Wang, Q., Qian, J., Zhang, W., Yang, R., Simulation of Flexible Assembly System Based on Rule Embedded Colored Petri Net Journal of ShangHai Jiao Tong University, 38, p. 8; Cai, Z., Artifical Intelligence Principles and Applications, pp. 59-61. , TSinghua University Press, Beijing",,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954503386

It is required to determine a proper mixture ratio for these materials blended to assure sintering production indices such as agglomerate composition and sintering permeability. Considering the relations between the mixture ratio and the production indices, an intelligent integrated model is firstly constructed to predict agglomerate compositions, which consists of Expertise-and-Mechanism-based model and Supervised Distributed Neural Networks. Based on the composition prediction model and reasoning rules for mixture ratio modification, a hierachical intelligent optimization strategy with expert reasoning is proposed to determine an optimal mixture ratio, which includes multi-objective optimization for the first blending process and area optimization for the second blending process. Practical running results show that the qualified rates of agglomerate compositions are increased by about 7% and the fluctuation of sintering permeability is reduced by 7.0 % through proper blending process according to the optimal mixture ratio, which effectively stabilizes the imperial smelting process.

Recent deregulation and liberalization are worldwide currents in the electric industry. The price competition was introduced in a spot market, and the price volatility is concerned because the demand side is non-elastic, and electricity differs from other general commodities. The authors firstly predict an uncertain electric power demand by using the auto-regressive model of the neural networks. The neural network is a popular feed-forward three-layer model, and the input variables of the neural networks include the historical demand, temperature, weather-related discomfort index, and the day of the week. Secondly, by using the demand forecasted and the past prices, we apply the technique for forecasting the electricity price of the next day. The utility of the proposed technique was verified by using real data of the electric power wholesale spot market.

This kind of model can improve the endpoint predicting precision of the steel carbon contents and temperature. After hidden information is exposed in the high feature space through the kernel function transformation, greedy algorithm is used to remove redundant information and reduce the dimensions. The extracted components are used as the new inputs of ANFIS, and the implication relation among the inputs is reflected by rules, which simulate the operators experience, and consequently reduce the influence resulted from different operators. When the practical data are simulated, the simulated results are close to the practical values. The method is effective.

It is the causation of parallel search ability in results space of some algorithms. Implicit parallelism of algorithm is analyzed by physical theory and find that the uncertainty and high entropy state of algorithm are the root of the implicit parallelism. But the uncertainty is the cost of implicit parallelism. In other words, if an algorithm wants to get high level implicit parallel computing ability it must reduce the computing precision. For an intelligence algorithm the apriori knowledge decides the search direction in results space and the implicit parallelism provides the high speed parallel search ability. According to this we can increase the apriori knowledge and implicit parallelism to get the high level intelligence algorithm. Correct search direction plus implicit parallelism is artificial intelligence. The implicit parallelism and the prior knowledge together form the two elements of intelligence algorithm: speed and direction. © 2008 IEEE.","Apriori knowledge; Entropy; High entropy state; Implicit parallelism; Uncertainty","Apriori knowledge; Artifical intelligence; Computing precision; Entropy state; High entropy state; Implicit parallelism; Parallel Computing; Parallel search; Physical theory; Prior knowledge; Search direction; Uncertainty; Entropy; Knowledge acquisition; Multi agent systems; Parallel architectures; Parallel processing systems; Time measurement; Uncertainty analysis; Parallel algorithms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tu, X.Y., (2006) Artificial Intelligence: Review & Prospect, , Beijing: Science Press; Gong, T., Cai, Z.X., Research development of natural computation (2006) Control Theory & Applications, 23 (1), pp. 79-85; Li DY, Cheung David , Ng V , et al.

Here the AI system itself and each intelligent agent will act as services. © 2008 IEEE.",,"Agents; Artificial intelligence; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Agent-based approaches; AI systems; Artifical intelligences; General approaches; Intelligent services; Service-oriented architectures; Software systems; Intelligent agents",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Alessandrini, M., Integration of intelligence into a semantic qos aware service retrieval application (2008) Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing (ASC08), pp. 7-12. , Palma de Mallorca, Spain, September; Alessandrini, M., Gnesi, S., Moiso, C., Koch, N., Case studies scenario description (2006) Deliverable, SENSORIA, , Pisa, Paderborn, Munich, Florence, August; Erl, T., (2005) Service-Oriented Architecture: Concepts, Technology, and Design, , Prentice Hall; Hanniman, J., The importance of soa for business intelligence (2008) Network World, , June; Kasabov, N., Introduction: Hybrid intelligent adaptive systems (1998) International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 6, pp. 453-454; (2007) Ag Webs: Web Services based on Intelligent Agent Platform, 1. , S.-H.

Compared the representation of AI with that of KI, the shortage of these methods is analyzed. With the case analysis, a new method which describes the programming process using the mental operation (MO) is given. The confirmatory factor analysis demonstrates that knowledge work process can be represented using MO. The sample data support that concept collection entire model formed with nine essential factors of the MO can represent knowledge work processes. It provides a basic concept and an idea to increase the efficiency of knowledge work.","Artifical intelligence; Cognitive engineering; Knowledge work; Knowledge work process expression; Mental operation","Knowledge based systems; Knowledge engineering; Artifical intelligence; Cognitive engineering; Knowledge work; Knowledge work process expression; Mental operation; Knowledge representation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Li, Y.-J., Ma, S.-D., Analysis of ""Philippe phenomena"" in software engineering (2004) Computer Engineering and Applications, 40, pp. 57-59; Davenport, T.H., Thomas, R.J., Cantrell, S., The mysterious art and science of knowledge-worker performance (2002) MIT Sloan Management Review, pp. 23-31; Wang, L., Li, Y.-J., The mind operations description of software programming tasks process (2006) Computer Engineering and Applications, 42 (4), pp. 51-53; Zheng, N.-N., Information processing for cognition process and new artificial intelligent systems (2000) China Basic Science, (8), pp. 9-18; Minsky, M., (1968) Semantic Information Processing, , Mass, USA: MIT Press; Feng, D., (2006) Neural Network Expert System, , Beijing: Science Press; Wang, Q.-L., On the change of the guiding principle in the study of artifical intelligence (2004) Social Science Research, (6), pp. 54-60; Sternberg, R.J., Beyond, I.Q., (1985) A Triarchic Theory of Human Intelligence, , New York, USA: Cambridge University Press; Steinbcrg, R.J., The theory of successful intelligence (1999) Review of General Psychology, 3 (4), pp. 292-316; Liu, Z.-X., Sternberg's three-element intelligent theory and its enlightment (1997) Journal of Mathematics Education, 6 (3), pp. 39-45; Herbert, A., Simon: Search and reasoning in problem solving (1983) Artif Intell, 21 (1-2), pp. 7-29; Byrne, B.M., (1998) Structural Equation Modeling with Lisrel, Prelis, and Smplis: Base Concepts, Applications, and Programming, , NJ: Lawernce Erlbaum Associates, Publishers Mahwah; Li, Y.-J., Research on the representation of the programming task process (2006) The 36th International Conference on Computers and Industrial Engineering (ICCIE), , Taipei, China: National Tsinghua University Press",,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55149104050

Prior work has explored issues like the merits of ""McCabes versus Halstead versus lines of code counts"" for generating defect predictors. We show here that such debates are irrelevant since how the attributes are used to build predictors is much more important than which particular attributes are used. Also, contrary to prior pessimism, we show that such defect predictors are demonstrably useful and, on the data studied here, yield predictors with a mean probability of detection of 71 percent and mean false alarms rates of 25 percent. These predictors would be useful for prioritizing a resource-bound exploration of code that has yet to be inspected. © 2006 IEEE.","Artifical intelligence; Data mining detect prediction; Empirical; Halstead; McCabe; Naive Bayes","Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Probability; Statistical methods; Defect predictors; Resource-bound exploration; Static code; Software engineering",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Halstead, M., (1977) Elements of Software Science, , Elsevier; McCabe, T., ""A Complexity Measure"" (1976) IEEE Trans.

Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses (a) von Foerster's contributions to understanding the limitations of the computer metaphor which has long dominated cognitive science, and (b) his theories concerning how reality is constructed in organizationally closed organisms, and what the underlying neural mechanisms are. The latter is exemplified with a simple neuro-robotic model that illustrates the constructive and anticipatory nature of memory. Findings - von Foerster's work on the integration of a radical constructivest philosophy of knowledge construction with models of the underlying neurophysiological and sensorimotor mechanisms is still highly relevant to the understanding of embodied cognition and robotic models thereof. Originality/value - This paper identifies conceptual contributions that von Foerster's constructivist cybernetics can make to cognitive science's still limited understanding of the embodiment of cognition and "" representation"". © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Cybernetics; Reality","Artificial intelligence; Cybernetics; Robotics; Artifical intelligence; Cognition; Cognitive science; Computer metaphors; Design/methodology/approach; Embodied cognition; Philosophy of knowledge; Reality; Cognitive systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Beer, R.D., A dynamical systems perspective on autonomous agents (1995) Artificial Intelligence, 72, pp. 173-215; Beer, R.D., Toward the evolution of dynamical neural networks for minimally cognitive behavior (1996) From Animals to Animats 4 - Proceedings of the Fourth International Conference on Simulation of Adaptive Behavior, pp. 421-429. , Maes, P.

A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm has been developed that allows the crusher internal geometry to be created and evaluated against multiple performance objectives. The multiple-objective approach is particularly important in mineral processing, as the optimum performance of single machines is often a trade-off between competing process drivers. A case study is presented that demonstrates the application of the technique to the design of cone crusher liners. New crusher liner profiles resulting from the application of the evolutionary algorithm suggest that significant improvements in the generation of lump product can be obtained. The extension of the approach to wider process plant design is discussed in terms of the objectives and issues to be addressed. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

An ANN consists of a set of processing units (nodes) which simulate neurons and are interconnected via a set of ""weights"" (analogous to synaptic connections in the nervous system) in a way which allows signals to travel through the network in parallel. The nodes (neurons) are simple computing elements. They accumulate input from other neurons by means of a weighted sum. If a certain threshold is reached the neuron sends information to all other connected neurons otherwise it remains quiescent. One major difference compared with traditional statistical or rule-based systems is the learning aptitude of an ANN. At the very beginning of a training process an ANN contains no explicit information. Then a large number of cases with a known outcome are presented to the system and the weights of the inter-neuronal connections are changed by a training algorithm designed to minimise the total error of the system. A trained network has extracted rules that are represented by the matrix of the weights between the neurons. This feature is called generalisation and allows the ANN to predict cases that have never been presented to the system before. Artificial neural networks have shown to be useful predicting various events. Especially complex, non-linear, and time depending relationships can be modelled and forecasted. Furthermore an ANN can be used when the influencing variables on a certain event are not exactly known as it is the case in financial or weather forecasts. This article aims to give a short overview on the function of ANN and their previous use and possible future applications in anaesthesia, intensive care, and emergency medicine.","Artifical intelligence; Artificial neural networks; Predictive models","algorithm; anesthesiology; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; central nervous system; computer prediction; computer simulation; computer system; emergency medicine; human; intensive care; methodology; review; training; Anesthesiology; Artificial Intelligence; Emergency Medicine; Humans; Intensive Care; Neural Networks (Computer)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Baxt, W.G., Use of an artificial neural network for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (1991) Ann Intern Med, 115, pp. 843-848; Baxt, W.G., Analysis of the clinical variables driving decision in an artificial neural network trained to identify the presence of myocardial infarction (1992) Ann Emerg Med, 21, pp. 1439-1444; Baxt, W.G., Shofer, F.S., Sites, F.O., Hollander, J.E., A neural computational aid to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (2002) Ann Emerg Med, 39, pp. 366-373; Dybowski, R., Weller, P., Chang, R., Gant, V., Prediction of outcome in critically ill patients using artificial neural network synthesised by genetic algorithm (1996) Lancet, 347, pp. 1146-1150; Ebell, H., Artificial neural networks for predicting failure to survive following in-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation (1993) J Fam Pract, 36, pp. 297-303; Flanagan, J.R., Pittet, D., Li, N., Thievent, B., Suter, P.M., Wenzel, R.P., Predicting survival of patients with sepsis by use of regression and neural network models (1996) Perform Qual Health Care, 4, pp. 96-103; Geldner, G., Schwarz, U., Ruoff, M., Romeiser, J., Lendl, M., Schutz, W., Georgieff, M., Entwicklung eines neuen Closed-Loop Systems.

But, non linearity of objective functions and constraint functions, which have frequently seen in practical problems, has caused a difficult situation for optimization. This difficulty mainly lies in the existence of several local optimum solutions. In this study, we have proposed a new global optimization methodology that provides an information exchange mechanism in the nearest neighbour method. We have developed a simple software system, which treated each design point in optimization as an agent. Many agents can search the optima simultaneously exchanging the their information. We have defined two roles of the agents. Local search agents have roles on searching local optima by an existing method like the steepest decent method and so on. Stochastic search agents investigate the design space by making use of the information from other agents. Through simple and several structural optimization problems, we have confirmed the advantages of this method. © 2001, The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

Testing criteria and test objectives define how it is to be tested. This paper describes an approach to black-box test-generation in which an AI (artificial intelligence) planner is used to generate test cases from test objectives derived from UML (Unified Modeling Language) Class Diagrams. The UML Class Diagrams are conceptual models of the systems under test. They differ from traditional design and requirements models in that they include information pertinent to test case generation. From these models, test objectives and a domain theory are: • obtained, • transformed to planner representations, and • input to the planner. The planner uses the problem description to generate a test suite that satisfies the UML-derived test objectives. This paper describes the application of the testing approach to an industrial problem. © 2000 IEEE.","Ai (artificial intelligence) planning; Test objective; Test-case generation; Uml (unified modeling language) class diagram","Artificial intelligence planning system; Class diagram; Object oriented model; Unified modeling language; Computational linguistics; Computer architecture; Computer programming languages; Computer simulation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Computer vision; Magnetic tape; Artificial intelligence",,,,,"-9619787","Manuscript received August 31, 1999; revised October 1, 1999.

Most books we review are aimed at AI practitioners or research scholars - both of whom are pushing at frontiers, although usually in different ways. This time, we've chosen a short reference work intended for AI novices: Artifical Intelligence Techniques: A Comprehensive Catalogue, 4th ed., edited by Alan Bundy (135 pp., $29.00, Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1996, ISBN 3-540-59323-3). The book's basic idea is to have a number of AI professionals develop short abstracts of AI techniques, along with supporting terminology, and to present these abstracts at a level accessible by someone either new to AI or in a different branch of AI. This goal is laudable. One of the more distressing, but inevitable (it seems), trends in AI is a fragmentation of the field into many subfields. A work such as that targeted by Bundy would help ease the fragmentation by at least giving us a common meeting place. Because this book is aimed partly at readers new to AI, we've selected two graduate students - Fran Bakowska, an MSc student and research assistant, and Robert Hawkins, a PhD student and graduate research assistant - to give short reviews. They are both from the Intelligent Systems Lab, which I direct. We decided to leave both reviewers to their own devices and asked them not to discuss the reviews with each other until they had submitted their reviews. Most often, reviewers for Intelligent Systems are well-established researchers in their own subareas of AI, who are reviewing the writings of other researchers in the same area; that model would not have worked well for this book. Both reviewers reach similar positions, as you'll see. Perhaps, as AI continues to build on successes, the creation of subfields will accelerate. If so, the AI community - or perhaps better said, the AI confederation - will need a resource such as AI Techniques aspires to be. Maybe such a resource could best be found in some Web-available form. Whatever form it takes, such a resource will no doubt help us, and novices in our area, understand each other, at least at an elementary level.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Turing, A.M., Computing Machinery and Intelligence (1950) Mind, 59, pp. 433-460. , Oct; Hodges, A., (1983) Alan Turing: the Enigma, , Random House, London",,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33751056226

Numerous site remediation technologies, generally calssified as ex-situ and in-situ remediation techniques, have been developed and implemented to clean up the contaminated sites in the last two decades. One of the problems associated with ex-situ remediation is the cost of operation. In recent years, in-situ techniques have acquired popularity. However, the selection process of the desired techniques needs a large amount of knowledge. Insufficient expertise in the process may result in large inflation of expenses. In this study, petroleum waste management experts and Artifical Intelligence (AI) researchers worked together to develop an expert system (ES) for the management of petroleum contaminated sites. Various AI techniques were used to construct a tool for site remediaiton decision-making. This paper presents the knowledge engineering processes of knowledge acquisition, conceptual design, and system implementation in the project. The case studies have indicated that the expert system can generate cost-effective remediation alternatives to assist decision-makers. © 1999 CURRAN-CONFERENCE.

A dedicated segmenting tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an ""intelligent"" border finder. Visualisation is performed by the ""Heidelberg Raytracer"". The vascular trees are visualised as 3D graphs. Pseudoconnections between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically. Security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal. Results: The 3D anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception. Security margins are demonstrated. Dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees. The system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour, security margin and dependent liver parenchyma. Conclusion: Three-dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology. Virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols, which can be quantified and modified interactively. This will make operation planning more objective; patient selection may be improved, and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested. Thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching, surgical training and planning. It may lead to improved surgical care.","Liver; Liver resection; Operation planning; Visualisation","algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; computer assisted tomography; computer interface; computer program; expert system; hepatic artery; human; instrumentation; liver resection; liver tumor; liver vein; patient care planning; sensitivity and specificity; vascularization; Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Expert Systems; Hepatectomy; Hepatic Artery; Hepatic Veins; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Patient Care Planning; Sensitivity and Specificity; Software; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; User-Computer Interface",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Borgefors, G., On Digital Distance Transformations in Three Dimensions (1996) Comput Vision Image Understand, 64, p. 368; Carter, R., Hemingway, D., Cooke, T.G., Pickard, R., A Prospective Study of Six Methods for Detection of Hepatic Colorectal Metastases (1996) Ann R Coll Surg Engl, 78, p. 27; Couinaud, C., (1957) Le Foie - Etudes Anatomiques et Chirurgicales, , Masson, Paris; Demiris, A.M., Meinzer, H.P., Cognition Based Development and Evaluation of Ergonomic User Interfaces for Medical Image Processing and Archiving Systems (1998) Med Inf, 22, p. 349. , London; Engelmann, U., Schröter, A., Baur, U., Werner, O., The German Teleradiology System MEDICUS - System Description and Experiences in a German Field Test (1997) Eur J Radiol, 26, p. 219; Fishman, E.K., Kuszyk, B.S., Heath, D.G., Gao, L., Surgical Planning for Liver Resection (1996) IEEE Computer, 29, p. 64; Hanisch, E., Hebgen, S.-O., Heller, K., Sänger, P., Herrmann, G., Zur Segmentanatomie der Leber - Eine sonomorphologische Sicht (1999) Chirurg, 70, p. 169; Kapur, J.N., Sahoo, P.K., Wong, A.K.C., A new method for grey level picture thresholding using the entropy of the histogram (1985) Comput Vision Graph Image Process, 29, p. 273; Leppek, R., Klose, K.J., 3D-Darstellung der Leber (1995) Radiologe, 35, p. 769; Marescaux, J., Clément, J.-M., Tassetti, V., Koehl, Ch., Virtual Reality Applied to Hepatic Surgery Simulation: The Next Revolution (1998) Ann Surg, 228, p. 627; Matsui, O., Takashima, T., Kadoya, M., Liver metastases from colorectal cancers: Detection with CT during arterial portography (1987) Radiology, 165, p. 65; Meinzer, H.P., Meetz, K., Scheppelmann, D., Engelmann, U., Baur, H.J., The Heidelberg Raytracing Model (1991) IEEE Comput Graph Appl, 11, p. 34; Miller, D.L., Simmons, J.T., Chang, R., Hepatic metastasis detection: Comparison of three CT contrast enhancement methods (1987) Radiology, 165, p. 785; Richter, G.M., Theobald, I., Roeren, Th., Wunsch, C., Die Spiral-CT-Portographie in der präoperativen Diagnostik von Lebermetastasen (1996) Chirurg, 67, p. 630; Zahlten, C., Jürgens, H., Peitgen, H.-O., Reconstruction of Branching Blood Vessels from CT-Data (1995) Visualization in Scientific Computing, p. 41. , Göbel M, Müller H, Urban B (eds) Springer, Wien",,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033088660

Patient selection is not always clear-cut, and there is inherent morbidity and mortality associated with the invasive and expensive surgical protocols. To determine whether patient selection might be facilitated by application of artifical intelligence, we developed a model that predicted seizure outcome after ATL, using a simulated neural network (SNN). Methods: Predictions of the model were compared with predictions derived from conventional discriminant function analysis. Neural networks and discriminant functions were devised that would predict the occurrence of both Class 1 outcomes (totally seizure-free), and Class 1 or Class 2 outcomes (nearly or totally seizure-free), using data from 87 patients from three surgical centers. The SNNs and discriminant functions were developed using data from a randomly selected subsample of 65 patients, and both models were cross-validated, using the remaining 22 patients. Results: The discriminant functions showed overall predictive accuracy of 78.5% and 72.7%, while the neural networks demonstrated overall accuracy of 81.8% and 95.4%. Conclusions: Simulated neural networks show promise as adjuncts to decision-making in the selection of epilepsy surgery patients.","Epilepsy; Neural networks; Outcome prediction; Surgery","anticonvulsive agent; adolescent; adult; article; artificial neural network; controlled study; discriminant analysis; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical decision making; morbidity; mortality; nuclear magnetic resonance; patient selection; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; temporal lobectomy; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Discriminant Analysis; Electroencephalography; Epilepsy; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Networks (Computer); Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Seizures, Febrile; Temporal Lobe; Treatment Outcome",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rougier, A., Dartigues, J.F., Commenges, D., A longitudinal assessment of seizure outcome and overall benefit from 100 cortectomies for epilepsy (1992) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatr, 55, pp. 762-767; Elwes, R.D.S., Dunn, G., Binnie, C.D., Polkey, C.E., Outcome following resective surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy: A prospective followup study of 102 consecutive cases (1992) J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatr, 54, pp. 949-952; Hermann, B.P., Wyler, A.R., Effects of anterior temporal lobectomy on language function: A controlled study (1988) Ann Neurol, 23, pp. 585-588; Cahan, L.D., Sutherling, W., McCullough, M.A., Review of the 20-year UCLA experience with surgery for epilepsy (1984) Clev Clin Q, 51, pp. 313-318; Berkovic, S.F., McIntosh, A.M., Kalnins, R.M., Preoperative MRI predicts outcome of temporal lobectomy: An actuarial analysis (1995) Neurology, 45, pp. 1358-1363; Perrine, K., Westerveld, M., Sass, K.J., Wada memory disparities predict seizure laterality and postoperative seizure control (1995) Epilepsia, 35, pp. 851-856; Jayakar, P., Duchowny, M., Resnick, T.J., Alvarez, L.A., Localization of seizure foci: Pitfalls and caveats (1991) J Clin Neurophysiol, 8, pp. 414-431; So, N., Olivier, A., Andermann, F., Gloor, P., Quesney, L.F., Results of surgical treatment in patients with bitemporal epileptiform abnormalities (1989) Ann Neurol, 25, pp. 432-439; Begley, C.E., Annegers, J.F., Lairson, D.R., Reynolds, T.F., Hauser, W.A., Cost of epilepsy in the United States: A model based on incidence and prognosis (1994) Epilepsia, 35, pp. 1230-1243; Wiebe, S., Blume, W., Girvin, J., Gafni, A., Economic evaluation of temporal lobe epilepsy surgery (1994) Epilepsia, 35 (SUPPL. 8), p. 46; Thadani, V.M., Williamson, P.D., Berger, R., Successful epilepsy surgery without intracranial EEG recording: Criteria for patient selection (1995) Epilepsia, 35, pp. 7-15; Dawson, A.E., Austin, R.E., Weinberg, D.S., Nuclear grading of breast carcinoma by image analysis: Classification by multivariate and neural network analysis (1991) Am J Clin Pathol, 95 (SUPPL. 1), pp. 229-237; Baxt, W.G., Use of an artificial neural network for data analysis in clinical decision-making: The diagnosis of acute coronary occlusion (1991) Neural Computation, 2, pp. 480-489; Baxt, W.G., Use of an artificial neural network for the diagnosis of myocardial infarction (1991) Ann Intern Med, 115, pp. 843-848; Lo, S.E., Freedman, M.T., Lin, S.J., Mun, S.K., Automatic lung nodule detection using profile matching and back-propagation neural network techniquees (1993) J Digit Imaging, 6, pp. 48-54; Wu, Y., Doi, K., Giger, M.L., Nishikawa, R.M., Computerized detection of clustered microcalcifications in digital mammograms: Applications of artificial neural networks (1992) Med Phys, 19, pp. 555-560; Grigsby, J., Kooken, R., Hershberger, J., Simulated neural networks to predict outcomes, costs and length of stay among orthopedic rehabilitation patients (1994) Arch Phys Med Rehabil, 75, pp. 1077-1081; Engel, J., Van Ness, P.C., Rasmussen, T.B., Ojemann, L.M., Outcome with respect to epileptic seizures (1993) Surgical Treatment of the Epilepsies, 2nd Ed., pp. 609-621. , Engel J, ed.

The article argues that teaching by showing is more relevent than the accepted methods of Colour Science, in the design of factory-floor vision systems. Fast hardware for colour recognition has been available for several years but has not yet received universal acceptance. This article explains how this equipment can be used in conjunction with symbolic processing software, based on the Artifical Intelligence language Prolog.

The hierarchical relation among the functions and an explanatory structure of it can be generated also. The outline of the methodology is as follows. First, by means of key-units, all of the main functions inhering in the plant can be extracted. Second, by using the knowledge of dependency among functions, the hierarchical relation of the plant's function can be generated. Here, the knowledge of structural conditions that a lowest-level-function has to satisfy and the semantics of each function are given in the form of data structure.

This feature enables VAs to be defined as network domain objects which conceal the details of computer communications and provide an agent-oriented environment for perspective sharing and coordination.

Prolog is a computer language mainly used in the areas of artifical intelligence studies. When we express the principles and the restrictions of POSA in Prolog, the Prolog language processor searches the solutions of the POSA almost automatically. This method is more faithful to the logic of POSA and more speedy than the quantification method of third type which Hayashi proposed to use for POSA.

There have been several expert systems developed in medicine to assist physicians with medical diagnosis. Recently, several programs focusing on drug therapy have been described. They provide guidance on drug interactions, drug therapy monitoring, and drug formulary selection. There are many aspects of pharmacy that AI can have an impact on and the reader is challenged to consider these possibilities because they may some day become a reality in pharmacy.",,"artificial intelligence; computer program; development; education; expert system; medicine; monitoring; pharmacy; review; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Medicine; Clinical Pharmacy Information Systems; Drug Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Expert Systems; Hospital Information Systems; Terminology; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026609212

For completeness, if the data base includes equations, a demon needs to be invoked not only when a term in the data base exactly matches its pattern, but also when some variant of a term in the data base matches. An incremental algorithm has been developed for invoking demons in this situation without generating all possible variants of terms in the data base. The algorithm is shown to be complete for a class of demons, called transparent demons, that obey a natural restriction between the pattern and the body of the demon. Completeness is maintained when new demons, terms, or equations are added to the data base in any order. Equations can also be retracted via a truth maintenance system. The algorithm has been implemented as part of a reasoning system called bread. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Automated deduction; pattern-directed invocation; truth-maintenance systems",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, H., Sussman, G.J., (1985) Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, , McGraw-Hill, New York, N.Y; Doyle, J., A truth maintenance system (1979) Artificial Intelligence, 12, pp. 231-273; Fay, M., ‘First order unification in an equational theory’.

The learning level has a hierarchical structure for recognition and planning, and is used for the strategy of robotic manipulation in conjunction with the knowledge base in order to expand the adaptive range. The recent information from the adaptation level updates the learning level through a long-term learning process. On the other hand, the adaptation is used for the adjustment of the control law to the current status of the dynamic process.",,"Artifical Intelligence - Applications; Neural Networks - Applications; Robots - Learning; Robots - Manipulators; Artificial Neural Networks; Heuristic Knowledge; Intelligent Control; Machine Learning; Neural Controller; Robots",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IEEE Neural Network Council;Int Neural Network Soc","1991 IEEE International Joint Conference on Neural Networks - IJCNN '91","18 November 1991 through 21 November 1991","Singapore, Singapore",17262,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0026268025

The broader question of expert systems for the design of more abstract maps, such as statistical maps, has seldom been addressed in the literature. It seems clear that an expert system for design of reference maps, locational maps, and some navigation aids may be more feasible in the short term than a system to generate locational maps as well as purely thematic and analytical graphics. In part this is because the symbology of locational maps is more standardized and thus design constraints may be more readily identified. The specificity of map purpose for locational maps also places finite bounds on the range of appropriate symbology, without limiting map projection, scale, use of color, and level of generalization. The purpose of this chapter is to present design criteria for a cartographic expert system that focuses on the problems of map execution, including compilation and production of base features and thematic overlays of locational information. Expert systems and artifical intelligence for other cartographic processes, such as digital scanning, or knowledge-based geographic information systems will not be considered. The discussion remains on a conceptual level. The components of a system and the required functionalities are identified, and the relationships between the two discussed. Progress to date on each phase of the cartographic process will be assessed through a review of the literature.

The expert system emulates human behaviour in solving problems thought to require experts for their solution by utilizing computer programs that incorporate experts' heuristic reasoning. In this paper, the application of KBES to aid the design of ball and roller bearings is discussed.

A bearing supports radial and axial loads, at the same time allowing relative motion between two elements of a machine.

In our approach, a Chinese character (word) is treated as a graph, rather than as a character of a language. It is then analysed, through pattern recognition, using some computing points associated with the Chinese character in the construction process used.

Besides data-entry and data-analysis, personal computers are used more and more for data-collection, experimental design and panel-management. Tests are prepared on the personal computer, the questions are displayed on screens in the tasting booths, the subjects can enter their responses directly and the results can be available instantaneously. In the last five years, several systems for automated sensory analysis have been developed. In the coming years, computers will become more powerful, cheaper, faster, and will have more memory. Although it is not clear at this moment which operating system will become the standard for the next decade, the software will certainly be more user-friendly. Graphical-user-interfaces will change the way we interact with the computer. New approaches to software development, like object-oriented programming, artifical intelligence and relational database management systems will make it possible to use the computer for more aspects of sensory evaluation. It is important to identify the different tasks in the laboratory that can be automated and to look for the right tools to use.

Specialist information can be represented as production rules, mathematical models and time-independent facts held in a database. All information, i.e., the rules, models and facts, can be assigned to positions in Cartesian space. The shell has been coupled to a knowledge base containing information on fire behaviour and the effects of fire on vegetation in part of Kakadu National Park, Northern Australia. This system is now installed at the Park headquarters. The information has been derived from experiments run over ten years and from general experience of the region. The first part of the base contains a model of fire behaviour believed to be applicable throughout the Park; the second part (fire effects) is restricted to regions typified by the experimental site. The expert system will be run and assessed by Park managers over the next few years. The system is flexible and allows the managers to modify rules and change 'facts' as further knowledge of fire behaviour and effects becomes available and to add mathematical models of fire behaviour when these have been calibrated for northern Australia. Whilst the suitability of the system for the Park managers is yet to be fully assessed, it is already cler that expert systems can assist scientists to develop models of the processes they study. © 1989.",,"artifical intelligence; environmental management; mathematical model; national park; Australia, Northern Territory, Kakadu National Park",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, (1986) Kakadu National Park Plan of Management, , ANPWS, Canberra, A.C.T; Barr, Feigenbaum, (1981) The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence, 1, p. 409. , Heuristech, Stanford, CA; Bobrow, Mittal, Stefik, Expert systems: Perils and promise (1986) Commun.

The authors propose a semantic generalized predicate logic that is based on probability theory and information theory for providing theoretical methods for processing uncertain knowledge in artifical intelligence (AI) applications. The basic concept of the proposed logic is that the interpretation of the well-formed formula (wff) containing uncertainty is represented by using conditional probability. By the interpretation model using the conditional probability, a lot of problems that are impossible to treat by conventional AI methods can be explained in terms of information theory. From the definition, the self-information of the wff, the mutual information between a couple of predicates, and information gain by the reasoning can be shown. Next, reasoning rules are evaluated using the information gain which expresses the difference between the prior information and the posterior information of the consequent wff. Finally, the authors give a new calculation method for reasoning that gives the most unbiased probability estimation, given the available evidence, and prove that the proposed method is optimal from the principle of maximum entropy, subject to the given marginal probability condition.",,"Information Theory; Probability; Abstract Only; Conditional Probability; Semantic Generalized Predicate Logic; Unbiased Probability Estimation; Uncertain Logic; Artificial Intelligence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IEEE, Information Theory Group, New York, NY, USA;Inst of Electronics, Information & Communication Engineers of","IEEE 1988 International Symposium on Information Theory - Abstracts of papers",,"Kobe, Jpn",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0024125474

Chemical problems can serve as test domains for the development of new artificial intelligence methods. Artificial intelligence techniques can also be applied to the solution of practical problems in chemistry. Applications in chemistry include problems where it is necessary to encode chemical expertise, and where chemistry is merely an additional domain to which standard artificial intelligence techniques can be applied. Programs exploiting encoded chemical expertise can assist in solving problems of structure elucidation, synthesis planning, and experiment design. Robotics methods based on artifical intelligence and expert systems can enhance the performance of chemical instrumentation.

This paper deals with the quality level prediction in concrete structures using the helpful assistance of an expert system, QL-CONST1, which is able to reason about this specific field of structural engineering. Evidence, hypotheses and factors related to this human knowledge field have been codified into a knowledge base. This knowledge base has been prepared in terms of probabilities of the presence of either hypotheses or evidence and the conditional presence of both.

For more analytical purposes the information capacity of the visual system may be assessed by tests of contrast sensitivity and peripheral vision. The visual system selectively reduces the spatial information content of the visual field to avoid overloading the limited capacity for perception and decision making in the brain. The ways in which this reduction occurs and the processing of spatial information is of interest in many disciplines, and theoretical knowledge has been accelerated by the study of artifical intelligence. These processes may be investigated in human subjects by psychophysical and electrophysiological techniques. This provides additional information for diagnostic purposes and will form the basis of new systems of clinical investigation. Copyright © 1988, Wiley Blackwell.

In the future, real-time sensing, intelligent processing, and dextrous manipulation will become more viable, but until then it is necessary to use humans for many critical processes. It is not obvious, however, how automated subsystems could account for human intervention, especially if a philosophy of “pure” automation dominates the design. Teleoperation, by contrast, emphasizes the creation of hardware pathways (e.g., hand-controllers, exoskeletons) to quickly communicate low-level control data to various mechanisms, while providing sensory feedback in a format suitable for human consumption (e.g., stereo displays, force reflection), leaving the “intelligence” to the human. These differences in design strategy, both hardware and software, make it difficult to tie automation and teleoperation together, while allowing for graceful transitions at the appropriate times. In no area of artifical intelligence is this problem more evident than in computer vision. Teleoperation typically uses video displays (monochrome/color, monoscopic/stereo) with contrast enhancement and gain control without any digital processing of the images. However, increases in system performance such as automatic collision avoidance, path finding, and object recognition depend on computer vision techniques. Basically, computer vision relies on the digital processing of the images to extract low-level primitives such as boundaries and regions that are used in higher-level processes for object recognition and positions. Real-time processing of complex environments is currently unattainable, but there are many aspects of the processing that are useful for situation assessment, provided it is understood the human can assist in the more time-consuming steps. This paper maps out the connections between computer vision and teleoperation, pointing to a new phase in the ongoing research in “supervised” or “semiautomatic” systems. © 1987 SPIE.",,"Automation; Computer hardware; Computer vision; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Image enhancement; Mobile robots; Object recognition; Remote control; Sensory feedback; Artifical intelligence; Complex environments; Computer vision techniques; Contrast Enhancement; Dextrous manipulation; Hardware and software; Intelligent processing; Situation assessment; Stereo image processing",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wolfe, W.J., Arensdorf, G., White, G., Pinson, L.J., Robotic locating system (1986) Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision, 726. , SPIE, Fifth In A Series; Magee, M., Nathan, M., A viewpoint-independent modeling approach to object recognition (1987) Journal of Robotics and Automation; Nitzan, D., Brain, A.E., Duda, R.O., The measurement and use of registered reflectance and range data in scene analysis (1977) Proceedings of the IEEE, 65, p. 2; Duane, G.S., Knowledge-based segmentation of road scenes (1986) Applications of Digital Image Processing IX, 697. , SPIE",,,,,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958482634

These situations, ranging from production systems to semantic net computations, are characterized by event horizons in space-time that determine the range of causal connections between processes. At transition, these event horizons undergo explosive changes in size. This phenomenon, analogous to phase transitions in nature, provides a new paradigm with which to analyze the behavior of large-scale computation and determine its generic features. © 1987.",,"SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND CYBERNETICS - Cognitive Systems; COGNITIVE MODELS; EVEN HORIZONS; LARGE-SCALE ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS; PHASE TRANSITIONS; TOPOLOGICAL CONNECTIVITY; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Anderson, (1983) The Architecture of Cognition, , Harvard Univ.

Routes are generated with the support of artifical intelligence techniques. Color displays of the route along any location of interest are being developed to provide for both top-down and perspective views allowing a direct correlation between views. The applicability of the concept has been successfully demonstrated through analysis of realistic scenarios and generation of representative color views and displays. The technique results in realistic routes over a network of roads and off-road regions. Route selection criteria include tradeoffs among transit speeds, threat laydown including terrain masking effects, and intervisibility effects when threat locations are highly uncertain.

TEMPLAR will build on technologies demonstrated by RADC, the Mitre Corp. , and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to incorporate natural language understanding, constraint and expert system-based planning, and advanced man-macine interface (MMI) techniques. The TEMPLAR ADM will assist Air Force mission planners in developing the Air Tasking Order (ATO) which defines targets, missions, aircraft assignment, weaponeering, and other data sent to the wings. The ADM will have near-operatioal functionality and packaging. During the development it will be demonstrated and evaluated at Blue Flag and AirLand Battle Management exercises, followed by delivery and installation in the RADC Battle Management Laboratory.",,"DECISION THEORY AND ANALYSIS - Military Purposes; SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND CYBERNETICS - Man Machine Systems; AIR FORCE MISSION PLANNING; NATURAL LANGUAGE SYSTEMS; TACTICAL EXPERT MISSION PLANNER; TEMPLAR; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"IEEE Computer Soc, Western Committee, Los Alamitos, CA, USA;IEEE, Los Angeles Council, Los Angeles, CA, USA","Proceedings - WESTEX-86: IEEE Western Conference on Knowledge-Based Engineering and Expert Systems.",,"Anaheim, CA, USA",8613,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0022614628

However, in some instances, the variability of the process characteristics makes it difficult to preset the controller parameters so as to achieve an acceptable performance and the processes are therefore operated under manual control. The majority of studies to resolve these difficulties have been based on establishing some form of mathematical model of the processes, but this approach has not only revealed the difficulty of obtaining the necessary basic data but also that non-linearities and variability of the process parameters restrict the usefulness of this approach. An alternative approach involving a more pragmatic method has also been developed during the past two decades. Some of these are described in the cited references and most of them make use of 'expert systems' by incorporating the experience and knowledge of skilled control engineers combined with 'artificial intelligence' which reflects the 'classic' response of a process, expressed in terms of lumped parameters.

Since the system must act as an intelligent assistant for a general physician, a major emphasis has been laid upon its interactive capabilities. In particular, the user can ask the system how a given conclusion has been reached (explanation facilities) and can alter the normal operation flow. In the design of the system, the different significance and availability of the clinical data and the laboratory tests have been taken into account: The investigations about a given patient start from the clinical data, and only when there is some evidence of hepatopathy are the results of some laboratory tests requested. The final result of the investigations consists of the assessment of the liver function in terms of four aspects (biosynthesis, cholestasis, cytolysis, reactivity), each of which is assigned a linguistic value describing its impairment degree. The techniques adopted in the system are based on Artifical Intelligence methodologies augmented with linguistic terms handled according to the fuzzy set theory. © 1984 Plenum Publishing Corporation.",,"computer analysis; diagnosis; human; liver; liver disease; liver function test; organization and management; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Human; Liver Diseases; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kulikowski, C., Artificial intelligence methods and systems for medical consultation (1980) IEEE Trans.

An inspection program consists of a series of high level goals to be satisfied. Goals are satisfied when specified information has been obtained regarding the part. There is a decision hierarchy, each level of which provides logic for partially decomposing goals into simpler goals. The control system executes the inspection program by interpreting the decision hierarchy logic. A world model hierarchy executing in parallel with the task decomposition hierarchy provides information which aids in the decomposition decisions at each level. The world model initially consists of prior knowledge of the part and workstation, and evolves as inspection proceeds, accumulating the results of inspection. The world model allows an inspection task to adapt to the particular part being inspected. Programming consists primarily of identifying tolerances to be verified and providing the relationship between tolerances and the geometry of the part. The latter task can be treated as a data base problem of providing a particular ""user view"" of the geometry of the part and can in large part be easily automated, although there are important computational geometry issues (path planning, surface fitting, etc.) that remain open. The more difficult problems of identifying top-level goals (i.e., tolerances), selecting the probing and the part setup, and so forth we propose to attack using artifical intelligence techniques. Artifical intelligence techniques will allow the convenient incorporation of quality assurance standards into inspection tasks. We expect that this work will also lead to a deeper understanding of data requirements for computer-aided design representation of parts. © 1984 CIRP.",,"DATABASE SYSTEMS - Applications; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TECHNIQUES; CONTROL SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE; INSPECTION CONTROL HIERARCHY; MACHINE MOTIONS; MULTI-AXIS COORDINATE MEASURING MACHINES; SERVO COMMANDS; INSPECTION",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Albus, J.S., Barbera, A.J., and Nagel, B.N.

The micro-computer detected and retrieved the characteristics of plotting curve of hearing loss level at each frequency through artifical intelligence technique. The authors calculated the mean value of hearing level at each frequency of 3000 audiograms, and some characteristics of plotting curve pattern were determined. The audiogram patterns were divided into segments according to these characteristics. By using regression equation technique for each segment, a computer-aided audiogram pattern classification procedure was established. The plotting curve recognition and judgement of hearing level utilizing the computer showed no significant differences from those done by physicians.

Thus, in this paper, we not only offer the world graph as a representation of relationships among situations the animal has encountered and may encounter again, but we also offer algorithms for how the information encoded in the world graph may be used by the animal in determining its behavior. Each node of the graph encodes a recognizable situation in the animal's world, but a given place may well be encoded in a number of different nodes. Nodes not only require algorithms for the recognition of the situation; they store information about drive reduction associated with the encoded situation. We note that the use of graphs as a basis for exploring some search space is well known in artificial intelligence (AI), but we stress the importance of the animal's exploration of its environment for growing the graph, as distinct from the mathematically described potential nodes frequent in AI search spaces. To explore a number of hypotheses about the way information in the world graph is used to guide the animal's movement, we recall a number of classical experiments on maze exploration by animals, and use them to argue for the nonlocal hypothesis (selection of a path does not depend only upon information about the immediate environment of the animal) and the competing nodes hypothesis (more than one drive may enter into the determination of the animal's behavior at any time). An important feature of the model is that it yields exploration and latent learning without the introduction of an exploratory drive. We also note that the performance exhibited by the model appears to be state-dependent when the animal operates under high drive levels. The drive-interaction matrix is offered as a subject for future research. We complement the presentation of the world graph model, its drive dynamics, and how these are constrained by experiments on maze behavior, with a brief analysis of maps in the brain. We distinguish egocentric maps–which we relate to the many visual systems–from allocentric maps. We offer a somewhat unconventional view of short-term and long-term memory. We examine cooperative computation in somatotopically organized networks, relating this to visually guided behavior in the frog, and to the interaction of colliculus and cortex in the control of eye movements. We examine, but do not advocate, the hypothesis that the hippocampus is a cognitive map. We do stress that if it is a cognitive map, it must be seen as a chart of the local neighborhood, rather than the whole atlas; and we note that the cognitive map hypothesis would lead one to expect the region to exhibit activation of place cells before the animal leaves the previous place. © 1982, Cambridge University Press.

The question is discussed here from the standpoint of formal logic: [AI] is represented by the class of first-order syntactical deductions and [HM] by the class of first-order semantical consequences. The logical system used is the J.A. Robinson's resolution-based logic, which is shortly introduced both as a first-order system and as a programming system. Then the Newell-Simon's Thesis can be replaced by the Hilbert's Thesis - the claim that the significant part of mathematics is captured by formal and finite manipulations on concrete symbols - and studied as a very abstract statement. Eventually a diagonal proposition, constructed within the resolution-based logic, shows that the Hilbert's Thesis is untenable, and the Newell-Simon's Thesis implausible.",,"Systems science and cybernetics; artificial intelligence; computer analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019835718

This approach is partly due, to the relative simplicity of designing binary switching systems, and to the fact that basic switching modules in common use are two-positional. Consequently, every variable in Boolean logic is assumed to be two-valued. However, because of real-world constraints, the attributes of system variables are often ambiguously defined. In other words, quite often variables might have values other than falsehood and truth. Cases with such attributes arise, for example in artifical intelligence and related subjects. Ever since Zadeh introduced the idea of fuzzy set theory [11 by utilizing the concept of membership grade, a number of authors have been concerned with the analysis and applications of fuzzy models. Especially, the relation of fuzzy to switching systems have been discussed in [2]—[12] and by other researchers in relation to other topics. In this paper we are concerned with the study of fuzzy switching functions and their properties.

An important area of research involves designing a machine that can adequately improve its own performance as well as solve other problems normally requiring human intelligence. Work in heuristic programming that seems most relevant to this goal will be discussed at length. Important subproblems are devising techniques for self-improvement, the general problem of deciding what task to best work on next in a network of tasks, and the general problem of how to mechanize learning or inductive inference. Some work in linguistics and pattern recognition is directly concerned with the induction problem. Another area of research that will be treated is simulation of organic evolution. © 1966, IEEE.
